                    <p class="w3-center">22/03/202</p>

                    <hr style="width:60%; margin: auto;" class="w3-opacity">

                    <p>
                        It's Christmas time in New York City, and it's time to to get back to web swinging through the snow with
                        none other than Miles freaking Morales! That's right people JoKishler is back with a review, and I know
                        it's been a while since I wrote a review,and that's because video editing takes up a crap load of time,
                        but hey, hopefully the blog will be bringing through a lot more content in the coming months. But
                        anyways back to the badass sequel game to Marvel's Spider-Man.
                    </p>
                    <img src="/Images/Gaming/Spider-Man/MM 2.jpg" style="width:100%;" alt="Spider-Men">
        
                    <h2>Miles > Peter</h2>
                    <p>Okay controversial heading I know. But playing as Peter vs playing as Miles, Miles is just an absolute
                        unit of a hero. His bioelectric abilities or “Venom power” and his invisibility powers just make him,
                        well miles beyond Peter. Yeah yeah, it’s a lame pun, but deal with it. It was clever as fuck and I stand
                        by it. But back to game, like it’s predecessor, Miles Morales allows us to experience what it’s like to
                        be the web head 2.0 in NYC and the fact that it happens during Christmas make NYC and the environment
                        even more beautiful. And trust me when I say it’s gorgeous, I experienced the smoothest gameplay and
                        graphics on the PS5 in 4K. Don’t believe me? Check out the photo below of Central Park.</p>
        
                    <img src="/Images/Gaming/Spider-Man/MM Snow.jpg" style="width:100%;" alt="Central Park">
        
                    <p>Now if that does not look breath-taking I don’t know what will. But Miles Morales takes us on a journey
                        when it is up to the young web head to take a crack of protecting NYC by himself, while Peter goes on
                        vacay. Balancing life, his mom’s campaign and trying to figure out how to be the Hero of Harlem, Miles’s
                        journey is rattled with emotional highs and lows throughout the story.</p>
        
        
                    <h2>Sweet but Too Damn Short</h2>
        
                    <p>After what was an absolute gem of a first game, I was hoping <i>Insomniac</i> could keep up to their own
                        high
                        standards. And God damn did they meet and exceed expectations. Gameplay is better, graphics are better,
                        and the story is insanely gripping with side activities and side missions having mini storylines of
                        their own. My one issue, actually my biggest issue with the game is length. As awe inspiring as the
                        game’s story is, it is far too short. And that includes collecting all the collectables and side
                        activities.</p>
        
                    <p>Centred mainly around Harlem, and the neighbourhood, the Spider-Man Miles Morales takes us on the battle
                        for Harlem between the newly formed group looking for notoriety, The Underground, led by the Tinkerer
                        and the extremely aggressive, corrupt company, Roxxon. Miles truly learns how to use his powers and how
                        to be a better Spider-Man. Caught between a few flashbacks and balancing life and Spidey duties, Miles
                        learns the true meaning of being a hero and the sacrifices that come with being Spider-Man.</p>
        
                    <h2>Spidey Strength, Venom Power and a Whole lot of Action</h2>
                    <p>Now the combat is not that much different than the first game, with the exception of Venom powers and a
                        few gadgets less. But racking up so insane combo numbers and witnessing the true raw power of Spider-Man
                        is still heap loads of fun. And for that, I’ve got some gameplay footage right here for you… ROLL IT!!!
                    </p>

                    <h2>Wrap It Up Web-Head</h2>
                    <p>Overall, <i>Insomniac</i>'s Spider-Man Miles Morales is a phenomenal game, with far too short of a story
                        line. Miles's suits are epic, and the character development seen is one of the best in recent games. We
                        all know what a true superhero game feels like and without a doubt know what being NYC's Friendly
                        Neighbourhood Spider-Man is all about. If anyone is hesistant about this game, you're a fool, a moron
                        and I blame that menace Spider-Man!!!!</p>
                    <p>As always, stay safe people. Wear a mask, wash your hands, follow social distancing and for the love of
                        god stay sane. Till next time, JoKishler out! (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻) </p>
