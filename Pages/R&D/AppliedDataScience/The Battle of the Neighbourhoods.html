            <h2 class="w3-center">Introduction</h2>
            <p> A venture capitalist is known as a private equity investor who seeks opportunity in high-growth
                potential
                companies such as small businesses and startups in exchange for a stake in the respective company. The
                risk-reward factor of investing in these companies can be drastic, and if invested correctly can yield a
                substantial return for the investor. Venture capital firms began in the United States in the early to
                mid-1900s and has continued to grow exponentially as the world evolved through the Dot-Com burst and
                into
                the Fourth Industrial Revolution<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.</p>

            <p>The popular television show Shark Tank and its respective spinoff such as Dragon's Den in the UK has
                brought
                to life the way investors, specifically venture capitalists invest their money in small businesses and
                startups. In order to mitigate the risks, investors must know about the business and what the plan would
                be
                to succeed.</p>

            <p>This project aims to provide information to venture capitalists on what businesses are popular based on
                data
                about Toronto, Canada. The idea is to be able to make valid assumptions based on the popularity of
                certain
                venues in the various boroughs. The information gathered will allow venture capitalists to know what
                type of
                businesses are in high-demand as well as potential opportunities for less popular businesses.</p>
            <h2 class="w3-center">Data</h2>

            Based on what we aim to achieve with this project, the data required includes:
            <ul>
                <li>List of postal codes, corresponding boroughs and neighbourhoods for the City of Toronto.</li>
                <li>The demographics of the Toronto neighbourhoods.</li>
                <li>The various venues such as restaurants, bars, coffee shops, malls, etc. around each of the
                    neighbourhoods.</li>
                <li>The longitude and latitude of each neighbourhood and venues.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Data Sources</h3>
            <p>The list of postal codes, boroughs and neighbourhoods are retrieved from a Wikipedia table listing all of
                the postal codes in Canada that begin with the letter M. This was chosen as the postal codes that begin
                with
                the letter M are the boroughs and neighbourhoods that are found within the city of Toronto. The original
                table is found at the link below:</p>

            <p><a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M</a>


                <p>This postal code data along with the corresponding boroughs and neighbourhoods will correlate
                    directly
                    with
                    the geospatial data file. This data file provides the longitude and latitude of each postal code
                    that is
                    stored in a <i>csv</i> file. The link to the file can be found at the link below:</p>

                <p><a href="http://cocl.us/Geospatial_data">http://cocl.us/Geospatial_data</a></p>

                <p> The demographics data is taken from the Toronto Open Data Catalogue, relating to neighbourhood
                    profiles.
                    The
                    csv file consists of the neighbourhood profiles from a census done in 2016, which includes
                    population
                    distribution across various races and religions, languages spoken, immigration and citizenship,
                    education
                    and finances. This file is provided as a <i>csv</i> file and can be found at the link below:
                </p>
                <p><a
                        href="https://ckan0.cf.opendata.inter.prod-toronto.ca/download_resource/ef0239b1-832b-4d0b-a1f3-4153e53b189e?format=csv">https://ckan0.cf.opendata.inter.prod-toronto.ca/download_resource/ef0239b1-832b-4d0b-a1f3-4153e53b189e?format=csv</a>
                </p>

                <p>These above links alongside the Foursquare API will be used to map the neighbourhoods and retrieve
                    the
                    data
                    relating to the various venues. For this project, due to the limitations of the free account on
                    Foursquare,
                    the search limit of the venues is set to 100 with a radius of 500 metres of each neighbourhood.</p>

                <h2 class="w3-center">Methodology</h2>
                <h3>Importing the Libraries</h3>
                <p> Various libraries will be used through the implementation of this project, with the main ones being
                    <code>pandas</code> and <code>numpy</code> to handle the data itself. The <code>geopy</code>,
                    <code>folium</code> and
                    <code>requests</code> libraries will handle longitude and latitude conversion, JSON handling and map
                    rendering
                    respectively. The <code>Sci-kit learn</code> library gives us access to the k-means clustering model
                    for our
                    project execution and analysis. Lastly, the <code>BeautifulSoup</code> library will extract data
                    from the
                    respective HTML pages and allow us to use that data in a dataframe for analysis and modelling.
                </p>

                <h3>Importing the Data Sources</h3>
                <h4>Toronto Neighbourhoods Data</h4>
                In order to obtain this data from the Wikipedia page, the <code>get</code> function is used to request
                the
                page and convert it to raw HTML text. Using the <code>BeautifulSoup</code> library the table can be
                identified
                and converted into raw HTML text. Following this, the table is then read as an HTML file and converted
                into a dataframe for processing. Figure 1 shows the original Wikipedia table whereas
                Figure 2 shows the same data after being converted to a dataframe.

                    <img src="../../../Images/Tech/Applied Data Science Capstone/WikiTable.png"

                    <figcaption>Fig.1: Toronto Neighboods Wikipedia table</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <figure>
                    <img src="../../../Images/Tech/Applied Data Science Capstone/WikiDf.png" alt="Wikipedia df"

                    <figcaption>Fig.2: Toronto Neighboods dataframe</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <h4>Preprocessing the Neighbourhoods Data</h4>
                <p> With the data having been imported correctly, it now must be preprocessed before any modelling and
                    analysis can be done. The first step is to drop all rows from the table where the boroughs are
                    <i>Not assigned</i>. The next step is to assign all <i>Not assigned</i> neighbourhoods the value of
                    their respective boroughs. Figure 3 shows the table after being preprocessed and ready
                    for assigning the respective longitude and latitude values to each location.</p>

                </figure>

                <h4>Geospatial Data</h4>
                <p>The Geospatial data is the data that will provide the geographical coordinates to the neighbourhoods,
                    specifically the centre point of each neighbourhood. The data is stores in a <i>csv</i> file, and
                    is read in as such and converted into a dataframe. Subsequently, this data must be merged with the
                    neighbourhoods dataframe for the data to be modelled and analysed. A left join is done on the
                    neighbourhoods table with the geospatial data table and the resulting dataframe can be seen in
                    Figure 4.</p>

                    <figcaption>Fig.4: Merged dataframe containing Neighbourhoods data</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <h4>Demographics data (used for in-depth analysis</h4>
                <p>The demographics data is a <i>csv</i> file that was extracted from the Toronto open Data Catalogue
                    and contained data from a 2016 census. With the amount of information in this file only two rows
                    were extracted, specifically the population of the neighbourhoods and the average income of the
                    neighbourhoods. This data was read in, preprocessed and merged with the Neighbourhoods dataframe.
                    The resulting table can be seen in Figure 5.</p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="../../../Images/Tech/Applied Data Science Capstone/InDepthdf.png" alt="In-depth df"

                </figure>

                <h3>Creating the Map</h3>
                <p>In order to generate an interactive map with points over each neighbourhood, the <code>folium</code>
                    and
                    <code>geopy</code> libraries are used. The <code>geopy</code> retrieved the centre coordinates of
                    the city of
                    Toronto, and the <code>folium</code> library is able to take the data from the dataframe as well as
                    the
                    location of Toronto and map it out accordingly as seen in Figure 6.</p>

                </figure>

                <h3>Retrieving the venue</h3>
                <p>With half of the data ready for modelling and analysis, we can now extract the data required from the
                    Foursquare API. The initial step is to set up your Foursquare credentials in order to retrieve the
                    requested information. Once authenticated, 100 venues within a 500 metre radius of each
                    neighbourhood. This data is requested as a JSON file and once received is converted into a dataframe
                    which can be seen in Figure 7.
                </p>

                <h4>Grouping the Venues</h4>
                <p>All the venues within the requested radius has been presented, however in order to gain a full
                    understanding of the data, the venues are grouped and counted. This is to observe what are some of
                    the popular venues within the city of Toronto. The results can be seen in Figure 8 which amounts to
                    a total of 273 unique categories of venues. Since no dictionary or
                    classification is done on the venue categories, a café and a coffee shop and a breakfast place are
                    all categorised as unique venues, which for this project was an accepted trade off.</p>

                <h3>One Hot Encoding</h3>
                <p>One Hot Encoding is a process where categorical variables can be converted in order for a machine
                    learning algorithm to process the data<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>. This converts the variables
                    into a binary format,
                    where a 0 indicates no occurrence and a 1 indicates an occurrence of that respective variable.
                    Figure 9 shows the venues dataframe after being passed through the <code>onehot</code>
                    function.

                    <figcaption>Fig.9: One Hot Encoded dataframe</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <h4>Calculating the average occurrence of each venues</h4>
                <p>Once processed and done, One Hot Encoding simply states if that categorical variable, in this case a
                    venue, is present in that neighbourhoods radius. It does not give an indication of how many times
                    that specific venue occurs in the radius. In order to achieve this, the neighbourhoods are grouped
                    and the means of each venue is calculated as seen in Figure 10.</p>

                </figure>

                <h4>Presenting the top 10 venues of each neighbourhood</h4>
                <p>Now that the means are calculated for each venue for each neighbourhood,the goal is to retrieve the
                    top 10 venues in each neighbourhood to allow investors to see what is the most popular venue
                    categories and what would pose the most competition. Figure 11 displays an example
                    of the top 10 venues of three different neighbourhoods. This raw text data can now be converted into
                    a dataframe for clustering, which can be seen in Figure 12.

                <h3>Clustering</h3>
                <p>The clustering used in this project is the <i>k-means</i> clustering. Five clusters were chosen for
                    the categorisation in order to prevent underfitting and overfitting of the data given the
                    concentration of the various neighbourhoods in the city of Toronto. Figure 13
                    shows the final processed dataframe after being passed through the machine learning algorithm.</p>

                <h2 class="w3-center">Results</h2>
                <h3>Cluster Map</h3>
                <p>The neighbourhoods are all clustered, and in order to gain a better understanding on how they were
                    clustered, a map is generated with each cluster being presented in a different colour.
                    Figure 14 displays the map, where the following clusters correspond to the
                    following clusters: gray is cluster 1; black is cluster 2; red is cluster 3; blue is cluster 4;
                    purple is cluster 5.</p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="../../../Images/Tech/Applied Data Science Capstone/ClusterMap.jpg" alt="ClusterMap"

                    </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <h3>Cluster 1</h3>
                <p>If we analyse cluster 1, we can see that based on the most popular venue across all the
                    neighbourhoods are parks and playgrounds. Across the top 10, it seems that all of these
                    neighbourhoods have similarities as the rank of the venues decrease, for example the fifth to the
                    8th most common venues for the first four neighbourhoods have <i>Dog run</i>, <i>Doner
                        Restaurant</i>, <i>Donut shop</i> and <i>Drugstore</i> in the same order.</p>.

                <figure>

                    </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <h3>Cluster 2</h3>
                <p>Cluster 2 has a <i>Pizza place</i> as it's most common venue in the various neighbourhoods. The
                    various types of restaurants are spread across the rank of each neighbourhood, however almost all
                    exist in each other, albeit at a lower or higher rank. An example of this would be the
                    <i>Eastern European restaurant</i> being the third most common venue for the first two
                    neighbourhoods, but the fifth most common venue for the fourth neighbourhood.</p>

                <h3>Cluster 3</h3>
                <p>Cluster 3 may not seem to have any similarities with regards to their venues, however these two
                    neighbourhoods are clustered together due to the similarities of their location. Although not
                    regarded as a venue, these two neighbourhoods are situated next to middle schools.</p>

                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <h3>Cluster 4</h3>
                <p>Cluster 4 is somewhat of an outlier as no other neighbourhoods are similar to this, as it's most
                    common venue is a <i>Filipino restaurant</i>. As no other cluster has this in common, this
                    neighbourhood is clustered by itself.</p>

                <h3>Cluster 5</h3>
                <p>Cluster 5 has the most neighbourhoods in it and shows blatant similarities in the most common venues.
                    These neighbourhoods are clustered together as they are all high-density residential areas.</p>

                <h2 class="w3-center">Discussion & In-Depth Analysis</h2>

                <p> For the in-depth analysis, 10 neighbourhoods were chosen and their respective populations and
                    average
                    income was extracted and combined into a single dataframe. These 10 cities will stand as an example
                    to
                    what can be done with this type of clustering and analysis. Figure 20 shows the
                    dataframe of the 10 neighbourhoods while Figure 21 presents the previously clustered
                    neighbourhoods and corresponding clusters.</p>


                <figure>
                    <img src="../../../Images/Tech/Applied Data Science Capstone/InDepthdf.png" alt="InDepthdf"

                    </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>The main analysis would rather happen from the dataframe as the pertinent data is presented. If we
                    take the second neighbourhood, <i>Humewood-Cedervale</i>, for example we can analyse the following:

                    <ul>
                        <li> The neighbourhood is in the fifth cluster, meaning it is in a residential area.</li>
                        <li> The top five most common venues are all healthy or sport related venues.</li>
                        <li> There is no healthy restaurant or healthy food store in the top 10 most common venues.</li>
                        <li> Given the smaller population size, but with the second highest average income in this list,
                            it could stand that a venture capitalist may see an opportunity to invest in a healthy food
                            store that already exists in the area to begin a small franchise.</li>
                        <li> Increasing the number of same-branded healthy food stores can result in more people having
                            access to the stores and make it potentially the sixth most common, if not one of the top
                            five most common venues in the neighbourhood.</li>
                    </ul>

                    If we take the <i>Woburn</i> neighbourhood, with the largest population size in the list, and one of
                    the lowest average income, we can deduce that this neighbourhood could be a potential location to
                    open a fast food restaurant. However, in the borough of <i>Scarborough</i>, the population is
                    potentially ethnically diverse given the various restaurants seen in the top 10 most common venues.
                </p>

                </figure>
                This implementation of this project can be drastically improved by utilising more data from the census
                file such as the ethnicity of people that live in the various neighbourhoods. Furthermore, the overall
                model can be improved by finding the optimal number of clusters and with increased usage of the
                Foursquare API, a user can map each neighbourhood's population as a chloropleth, while adding markers to
                the various venues that are present.



                <h2 class="w3-center">Conclusion</h2>
                A project was implemented on analysing data of the city of Toronto relating to its neighbourhoods. The
                data was sourced from various locations, preprocessed and presented accordingly. The data was then
                modelled and clustered using the k-means clustering machine learning algorithm, and an analysis was done
                on the results. An in-depth analysis was done given more information such as population and average
                income of the neighbourhood to answer the problem posed in this project. Overall, the project was
                successful but can stand to be improved with recommendations being given.
