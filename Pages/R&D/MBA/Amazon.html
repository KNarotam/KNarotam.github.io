            <h1 class="w3-center">Executive Summary</h1>
            <p>Tesla Inc., is 100th on the Fortune 500 list and is a leader in the automotive industry specialising in
                their electric vehicles and sustainable energy storage and generation. Tesla&rsquo;s plans for
                internationalisation was researched and investigated, specifically looking at Human Resource Management
                (HRM) and International Human Resource Management (IHRM). An environmental analysis is done on the
                company using SWOT and PESTLE analysis; and any challenges identified are analysed against how they
                would affect the HRM practice at Tesla. These policies are then reviewed and analysed to see how they
                would enable Tesla to overcome their internationalisation challenges. Hofstede&rsquo;s cultural
                dimensions were used to analyse the difference in culture between USA and China with the most noticeable
                difference being that of individualism vs. collectivism. Each of the cultural dimensions are further
                discussed and ways of integrating the cultural differences are explored; as well as recruitment
                strategies are researched and presented as a way for Tesla to hire host country nationals. The trait and
                behavioural theories of leadership are reviewed with the behavioural theory being analysed as a suitable
                leadership theory for Tesla&rsquo;s culture. Research and analysis are further done on IHRM, looking at
                how expatriates are selected, trained and the focus of expatriate management. Cisco Systems Inc. is used
                as a multinational company with great HRM practices, with special focus given on expatriate compensation
                and performance management. Lastly, recommendations are given for Tesla&rsquo;s internationalisation
                plans, specifically referring to adapting their HR policies for internationalisation, creating a
                well-structured expatriate training programme, and recruiting host country nationals.</p>


            <h1 class="w3-center">1. Introduction</h1>

            <p>Tesla, Inc., commonly and hereon referred to as Tesla, currently 100th on the Fortune 500 list; is the
                world&rsquo;s leading manufacturer in electric vehicles in conjunction with sustainable energy storage
                and generation. Defined by their mission to &ldquo;accelerate the world&rsquo;s transition to
                sustainable energy&rdquo;, Tesla has grown to become a household name and leader in the transport
                industry (Tesla, Inc., 2020). In 2018, Tesla had established its subsidiary in Shanghai, with an
                agreement with Chinese authorities to build its first manufacturing factory outside of the United States
                (BBC, 2018).</p>

            <h2 class="w3-center">1.1. Environmental Analysis</h2>
            <p>In order to understand and identify the challenges that Tesla are likely to
                face in the international environment, an environmental analysis &ndash; both internal and external
                &ndash; must be done on the company itself.</p>

            <h3 class="w3-center">1.1.1. SWOT Analysis</h3>
            <p>A SWOT analysis can be beneficial to HR as it can allow the department to better manage
                the company&rsquo;s strategic plan and overall operations of the human resources in all the necessary
                departments. This allows HR to hone in on the human resources within each department, enforcing the
                strengths; addressing the weaknesses; utilise the opportunities; and mitigate any threats (Sarokin,
                2020).</p>

            <p>Figure 1 presents the SWOT analysis of Tesla, with its presented strengths clearly setting the company up
                for success in the international market. However, the weaknesses relating to its current production of
                vehicles and subsequent effects of it are localised to the United States only as expanding its current
                factories pose a challenge. The internationalisation of Tesla by building a factory in Shanghai allows
                Tesla to seize the available opportunities presented to the company by building on the brand and its
                value. Although the threats presented will be ever growing, especially in a market as rapidly changing
                as China, the company must look to adjusting their strategies accordingly while continuously building on
                their current strengths,</p>

            <img src="Figure1.png" style="width:100%;" alt="Figure 1">
            <figcaption class="w3-center">Fig.1 - SWOT Analysis of Tesla Inc. (Gupta, 2020)</figcaption>


            <h3 class="w3-center">1.1.2. PESTLE Analysis</h3>
            <p>A PESTLE analysis can have a major impact on HR as it allows the department to ensure that the company is
                compliant and safe from any repercussions. It allows the department to not only put focus on the company
                and its objectives and strategy but also its employees and accommodating their need, especially in an
                international environment (Frue, 2019).</p>

            <p>Figure 2 presents the PESTLE analysis for Tesla, which focuses more on the external environment of Tesla
                specifically factors that affect the internationalisation of the company presenting various
                opportunities and threats. While internationalisation of Tesla will result in a multitude of
                opportunities for the company, especially from a political, economic, technological and environmental
                standpoint, Tesla does face many challenges from a legal, sociocultural and even political factors.</p>

            <img src="Figure2.png" style="width:100%;" alt="Figure 2">
            <figcaption class="w3-center">Fig.2 - PESTLE Analysis of Tesla Inc. (Kissinger, 2019)</figcaption>

            <h3 class="w3-center">1.1.3. Overall Critical Analysis</h3>

            <p>A country like China has incentives for both manufacturers and consumers to purchase and manufacture
                electric vehicles respectively, with expectations that at least 20% of the vehicles will be electric by
                2025. This creates a huge opportunity for Tesla to open their factory within Shanghai, as the company
                will be able to manufacture their cars while receiving subsidies from the government. However, in China
                given the abundance of a workforce and technological components the supply of the vehicles could surpass
                the demand for it leading to pricing pressures. The construction of the vehicles will bound by the laws
                of the host country, for example using locally sourced components, requiring a strategic adjustment for
                Tesla to ensure the quality remains the same, while using different components. Lastly, the increase in
                rivals within the industry presents an ever-growing concern, with a lesser valued and known brand, these
                rivals may be able to out-perform Tesla in the developing markets outside of the USA (Lopez, 2019).</p>

            <p>These noticeable challenges impact the HRM practices at Tesla in many ways. The senior positions in the
                new factory should be taken up by experienced Tesla employees and can assist in recruiting the correct
                type of employees in the factory. The use of expatriate senior managers and their knowledge of the
                requirements for a job will allow Tesla to recruit correctly and efficiently. However, the recruitment
                of local employees may be challenged by rivals, specifically local rivals. The forced use of locally
                sourced components does mean that the company needs a team dedicated to building new relationships with
                local suppliers to ensure the quality of the vehicle is up to the Tesla standard. This leads to ensuring
                that all local employees are trained, coached and retained correctly to ensure that the newly formed
                international division of the company can continue to be a competitor in the market.</p>

            <h2 class="w3-center">1.2. HRM Policy Analysis</h2>
            <p>HRM policies and procedures are used as a reference to create a set of guidelines for managers and
                supervisors that allow them to manage their subordinates defined by the company which are further
                governed by local and international law. The are many key elements that form the fundamental base of HR
                policies such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Equal opportunities policy</li>
                <li>Hiring, recruiting and onboarding employees</li>
                <li>Offboarding and terminating employees</li>
                <li>Wages</li>
                <li>Codes of conduct</li>
                <li>Performance monitoring</li>
                <li>Working hours</li>
                <li>Use of company resources</li>
                <li>Disciplinary actions.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These are some of the key fundamentals for creating a company&rsquo;s HR policies which lead into
                creating a handbook for employees to aid them in managing expectations of the company (Withaar, 2019).
                Tesla&rsquo;s employee handbook has changed over the years from being a long, formal document into a
                four-page handbook, aptly titled &ldquo;The Anti-Handbook Handbook&rdquo; (Babal, 2020).</p>

            <p>The internationalisation of Tesla will impact all of these elements of an HR policy, however given the
                way the Tesla handbook is written, it gives employees the freedom to be innovative and challenge the
                company through any level of hierarchy. While the handbook does address the key elements in a different
                manner, this allows Tesla to adapt it with ease to international laws and policies (Tesla Inc., n.d.).
                Recruiting local employees can be done by simply ensuring that Tesla adheres to the host country&rsquo;s
                law, as Tesla&rsquo;s leader does not require specific educational criteria, but rather looks at how an
                individual can impact the company with innovation and motivation (Kelly, 2020). By enforcing
                Tesla&rsquo;s &ldquo;Anti-Handbook Handbook&rdquo; in its internationalisation strategy allows Tesla to
                overcome many HRM policy challenges as this type of handbook can be constantly updated and adapted to
                the necessary markets.</p>

            <p>One of the greatest challenges that faces Tesla in their internationalisation strategy lies with the
                expatriate employees. These employees will require extensive training to understand and adapt to new
                cultures and new norms while assisting the company in creating a good foundation in the new market. The
                onboarding, training and development of local employees to attain senior positions and have Tesla retain
                these employees is an ever-growing challenge in China. However, given Tesla&rsquo;s &ldquo;Goals and
                Feedback&rdquo; section within their handbook, allows them to overcome this challenge by constantly and
                consistently setting achievable expectations for employees to attain and be rewarded for it (Froese, et
                al., 2019).</p>


            <h1 class="w3-center">3. Literature Review</h1>
            <h2 class="w3-center">3.1. Hofstede’s Cultural Dimensions</h2>
            <p>Hofstede&rsquo;s study on how culture influences the values in the workplace is one of the most
                comprehensive done. The results of the framework have allowed management in multi-national enterprises
                (MNE) to be able to understand the differences between countries and how to manage these differences
                (OpenStax, 2019).</p>
            <img src="Figure3.png" style="width:100%;" alt="Figure 3">
            <figcaption class="w3-center">Fig.3 - Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions Comparison of USA and China (Hofstede
                Insights, 2021)</figcaption>
            <p>Figure 3 presents a recreated version of the differences in the cultural dimensions between USA and China
                from Hofstede Insights (Hofstede Insights, 2021). While the difference in culture is significantly
                noticeable, each dimension indicates a different aspect that needs to be managed.</p>

            <h3 class="w3-center">3.1.1. Power Distance Index (PDI)</h3>


            <p>The PDI is a measure of the degree of inequality that exists within society
                of that country (Hofstede, et al., 2010). China&rsquo;s high score of 80 indicates that the inequalities
                that currently exist within its society is acceptable, as aspiring beyond their current stand point
                should not be allowed (Hofstede Insights, 2021). USA with a low score of 40 shows that social inequality
                exists, however allowing society to aspire to reach beyond their norms is encouraged by society.</p>

            <h3 class="w3-center">3.1.2. Individualism vs. Collectivism (IDV)</h3>

            <p>The IDV measures how a person is brought up within their
                society, with individualism being defined as &ldquo;ties between individuals are loose&rdquo;, whereas
                collectivism is defined as the opposite, where individuals are &ldquo;integrated into strong, cohesive
                in-groups&rdquo; (Hofstede, et al., 2010). USA&rsquo;s high score of 91 coupled with its low PDI score
                of 40 indicates how USA is generally branded as a country to achieve one&rsquo;s dreams (Hofstede, et
                al., 2010). China&rsquo;s low score of 20 shows how society tends to work together in groups whereby
                companies regard their employees as family (Garcia, et al., 2014).</p>

            <h3 class="w3-center">3.1.3. Uncertainty Avoidance (UAI)</h3>
            <p>The fear of the unknown, specifically the uncertainty of what will
                happen in the future is what is measured by UAI (Hofstede, et al., 2010). China&rsquo;s low score of 30
                is an indication of the country and laws as well its culture as a whole. Subsequently, USA having a
                below-average score of 46 shows that the society prefers to follow more consistency than China, however
                will still allow and accept innovation and change as a whole (Garcia, et al., 2014).</p>


            <h3 class="w3-center">3.1.4. Masculinity vs. Femininity (MAS) </h3>
            <p>MAS looks at measuring how society motivates themselves, whether
                seeking power and performance (masculine) over enjoyment and comfort (feminine) (Hofstede, et al.,
                2010). The similarly high values of 62 and 66 for USA and China respectively show how both societies are
                driven by success and will continue to perform at high levels putting work life ahead of family life;
                something that is seen more and more equally for both men and women (Hofstede Insights, 2021) (Garcia,
                et al., 2014).</p>

            <h3 class="w3-center">3.1.5. Long-Term vs. Short-Term Orientation (LTO) </h3>
            <p>LTO is a measure based on how society want to move forward,
                where long-term is focused on the rewards of the future through perseverance whereas short-term looks at
                preserving traditions of the past and present (Hofstede, et al., 2010). USA&rsquo;s low score of 26
                indicates how society is more practical, having a firm grasp of what is considered good and bad.
                China&rsquo;s high score of 87 shows how well the country is more pragmatic, being able to take
                traditions and change and adapt them going forward, showing strong perseverant traits in achieving
                results (Hofstede Insights, 2021) (Garcia, et al., 2014).</p>

            <h3 class="w3-center">3.1.6. Indulgence vs. Restraint (IND)</h3>
            <p>IND looks at measuring how much society allows for gratifying certain desires to make life more enjoyable
                and fun(Hofstede, et al., 2010). China&rsquo;s low score of 24 shows how restrained the country is and
                that
                indulgence is outside of the social norm. However, USA&rsquo;s high score of 68 is proof of the adage,
                &ldquo;work hard and play hard&rdquo;, as this is something seen throughout society by showing the
                personal indulgence on all social media platforms (Hofstede Insights, 2021).</p>

            <h2 class="w3-center">3.2. Synthesising the Integration of Cultural Differences</h2>
            <p>As China allowed the investment of foreign businesses into their domestic market, the categorisation of
                the ownership of businesses have changed, with three distinct categories being seen, namely:
                state-owned, privately owned, and US-owned (Kim, et al., 2016). Based on Hofstede&rsquo;s cultural
                differences seen in Figure 3, there are definite differences between US and China cultures. For example,
                policies relating to rules and various product catalogues have been put in place that seemingly
                discriminate against foreign companies (Browne &amp; Chao, 2010).</p>

            <p>While trade between USA and China is continuously growing, US-owned firms within China display a more
                Westernised management style, which align towards to the high IDV measure of the US society being
                individualistic and driven as opposed to state-owned businesses (Kim, et al., 2016). Although this does
                indicate that Tesla should not have much of an issue with regards to the management of local employees,
                it can be suggested that expatriates should be knowledgeable of all cultural dimensions as this allows
                the expatriates to better manage stakeholders. This in turn would mitigate potential organizational
                performance barriers by understanding how the various cultural dimensions can affect decision making
                (Ray, 2011).</p>

            <p>According to Kim et al., managers that work in US-owned firms in China tend to see inefficiency due to
                the cultural differences, as in general US firms would see a higher IND and MAS measure while their LTO,
                UA and PD measures are significantly lower; as opposed to state-owned firms having high values for
                LTO,UA, PDI while MAS measures whereas MAS and IDV are significantly lower (Kim, et al., 2016). A
                challenge arises where it is expected that local employees should adhere to the Western-styled culture
                seen in US firms. While expatriates should be trained to understand and engage with the culture within
                China, it can be suggested that in order to ensure that the internationalisation of Tesla is successful
                while achieving organisational objectives, local employees must be trained in a manner that allows them
                to understand and engage with the US culture.</p>

            <p>The training of expatriate managers to understand the culture within China would also allow the company
                to adapt to its internationalisation in a faster manner. As the company would be inclined to source
                components locally, understanding the local culture would enable the expatriates to manage relations
                with suppliers and potential partners with minimal conflict as understanding how the state-owned firms
                operate culturally (Lopez, 2019).</p>

            <h2 class="w3-center">3.3. Recruitment Strategies</h2>
            <p>Tesla&rsquo;s internationalisation strategy is one that would be increasingly welcomed within China as
                there is a demand for the use and implementation of electric vehicles, especially in Shanghai where
                sales are recorded as the highest (Xu, et al., 2020). Since the senior managers will be expatriates, the
                focus would be to hire host-country nationals (HCNs) or local employees. With Tesla being a US-firm, it
                can be suggested that the culture within the company would be that similar to US culture, as a result
                adapting the HRM practices from the west can be done so with limited effort (Cooke, 2012). This would
                become something that is appealing to HCNs as state-owned businesses are more susceptible to government
                intervention, interference and political pressure. In conjunction to this, state-owned businesses are
                subject to the &ldquo;three irons&rdquo;, whereby the government appoints management, promotions and
                salary (Miedtank, 2017).</p>

            <p>While using aspects of culture and minimised government intervention as an incentive to work for Tesla,
                the company could pursue various hiring options. Wholly Foreign Owned Entity (WFOE) could employee
                talent from both the host country or the parent country. This can be managed by hiring an experience HR
                to handle the compliance and administrative operations, however this may be costly to the company. The
                other option is to outsource to an HR agency, through which all administrative tasks such as hiring and
                firing, payroll, housing, etc. can be handled. The benefit of using an HR agency is that it is highly
                recommended and more reliable for the company (HROne, n.d.). Another option would be having Tesla create
                their own HR department catered to hiring in China, this will allow the HR department to utilise
                channels such as WeChat to hire local talent to cater for the Chinese market itself (Sun &amp; Goh,
                2020).</p>

            <p>Zhong et al. had conducted research on various MNEs through a multiple case study approach, with one of
                the cases being similar to the requirements for Tesla. It was found that hiring more HCNs allowed for
                low cost and high quality of service, while management was still controlled by PCNs (Zhong, et al.,
                2021). Other benefits of hiring HCNs include eliminating language and other barriers, a reduction in
                hiring costs as no work permits would be required, HCNs stay in positions longer, given the fact that
                the firm is US-owned, employees can achieve higher levels of individualism.</p>

            <h1 class="w3-center">4. Application of Theory into Practice</h1>
            <h2 class="w3-center">4.1. Behavioural Dimensions</h2>
            <h3 class="w3-center">4.1.1. Theories of Leadership</h3>
            <p>A leadership theory is defined as the explanations, ideas and thoughts of how and why certain individuals
                become leaders. It looks to answer the question of whether leaders are born or if they are made.
                (Corporate Finance Institute, n.d.). This leads to two theories that define whether leaders are born or
                made, which are: trait theory and behavioural theory.</p>

            <p>Trait theory states that leaders are naturally born leaders, that any leadership traits are a part of
                their personality. The core traits of a leader as identified by trait theory include emotional
                intelligence and maturity; cognitive ability; knowledge of business; integrity and honesty; motivation;
                drive for success; and confidence within themselves and their abilities (Piyu, 2019).</p>

            <p>Behavioural theory rejects the idea of trait theory and that leaders are born, but rather identifies that
                leaders can be developed and trained. With a positive atmosphere and relevant training, leadership
                qualities can be developed while focusing on the behaviours of leaders as opposed to their
                characteristics (Piyu, 2019). Table 1 presents the differences between trait theory and behavioural
                theory, comparing the strengths and limitations/drawbacks of each theory.</p>

            <h3 class="w3-center">4.1.2. Analysis of Leadership Theory</h3>
            <p>Tesla&rsquo;s plan to internationalise the organisation and build a factory in Shanghai is a welcomed one
                within the industry and would be increasingly positive for the company itself. Although Elon
                Musk&rsquo;s leadership style is that of a servant leader, the solo effect that he has on his company,
                its share price and investors could be cause for some concern. (Khan, 2021). The behavioural theory of
                leadership would be the most suitable for Tesla&rsquo;s internationalisation as this would conform to
                Tesla&rsquo;s organisational culture of encouraging and motivating employees of all levels to be
                innovative and look for ways that would allow Tesla to have a competitive advantage. By having
                management use the organizational culture to optimise the way employees achieve and innovate creative
                behaviours, it allows the company to remain and hold a competitive advantage (Meyer, 2019).</p>

            <p>Behavioural theory would allow employees to step up with innovative solutions and ideas and begin to
                learn leadership qualities while implementing their solution. Using this leadership theory allows
                employees to work as the theory suggest and learn the various qualities that would be best for the work
                at hand. The internationalisation will allow host country nationals to learn the behaviours of senior
                management, adapt and improve on those behaviours within their local environment making that subsidiary
                more efficient from a leadership perspective.</p>

            <p>Behavioural theory is more suitable for Tesla&rsquo;s internationalisation as innovation would require
                constant change and adaption. No specific style of leadership or trait of leadership will be consistent
                throughout any drastic changes and so having employees and leaders, whether expatriate or local, be
                trained and upskilled according to the change that is being implemented will allow Tesla to maintain
                effective leadership while remaining competitive and being ahead of said competitors.</p>

            <p>One of Tesla&rsquo;s features of its organisational culture is to &ldquo;think like owners&rdquo;. This
                means that Tesla uses this as a motivational tool for employees by allowing them to think as if they own
                the company. It in turn allows the company to maintain a specific mindset catered to supporting the
                business development (Meyer, 2019). Allowing employees to think like they own Tesla, gives them all an
                opportunity to develop and unconsciously learn leadership skills, traits and behaviours making the
                behavioural theory a more suitable choice.</p>

            <p>Subsequently, Tesla&rsquo;s last feature of its organisational culture is &ldquo;we are ALL IN&rdquo;,
                means that employees must be unified into teams that continuously work to improve the business. This
                would minimise conflict, develop synergy through the human resources of the company and increase the
                collaboration by using each employee&rsquo;s skills and talents to their maximum potential (Meyer,
                2019). The constant collaboration would allow leaders to emerge making the behavioural theory a more
                suitable leadership theory.</p>

            <h2 class="w3-center">4.2. Role of IHRM</h2>
            <h3 class="w3-center">4.2.1. Selection Process</h3>
            <p>Multinational corporations (MNCs) are known for having employees from all over the globe working within
                the company and in order to employee the necessary talent can follow any of the three main staffing
                strategies:</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left:26px;">
                <li>Parent-Country Nationals (PCN)</li>
                <li>Host-Country Nationals (HCN)</li>
                <li>Third-Country Nationals (TCN).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>PCNs are regarded as your expatriates and determining whether or not they will be successful and selected
                for the position is based on various criteria, which can be seen in Figure 4.</p>

            <p>The job factors relating specifically to the technical skills is one of the most crucial determinants for
                the success of an expatriate, as being away from the headquarters the usual sources of information and
                assistance is a distance away. The &ldquo;unidimensional approach&rdquo; is created as the method that
                aligns to a candidate have the minimum requirements for the expatriate job which is the technical skills
                and abilities. Although research and arguments are had over a more balanced approach, the
                &ldquo;unidimensional approach&rdquo; is still regarded as the bare minimum for being selected for the
                expatriate position (Wang, et al., 2011). Once a PCN is chosen, the correct type of visa must be applied
                for and issued, as well as considering training prior to moving.</p>

            <p>An HCN selection is far simpler than selecting an expatriate. While the matter of their technical skills,
                organisational cultural fit and overall character is still incredibly considered, an HCN is easier to
                hire as there are less costs involved from a moving and training perspective. While expatriates may and
                will take time to adjust and adapt to their new surroundings, HCNs are able to be more productive from
                the start as culturally they have overcome all challenges and concerns regarding laws (University of
                Minnesota, 2011). In addition, the compensation of an HCN could be significantly lower than that of an
                expatriate making hiring of an HCN faster as less negotiations would be involved.</p>

            <figcaption class="w3-center">Fig.4 - Selection Criteria for Expatriate Selection adapted from (Wang, et
                al., 2011) and (University of Minnesota, 2011)</figcaption>
            <h3 class="w3-center">4.2.2. Expatriate Training</h3>
            <p><b>Cultural training</b> is the initial and most important training that is presented for expatriates.
                Generally, this training is done prior to the employee&rsquo;s departure to the host country. The
                purpose of this training is to immerse the expatriate into the new culture that they will be living in.
                This training includes learning the etiquettes, history, religion or even the political aspects of the
                culture. It can further be extended to understanding the management style of the country, food and
                logistics such as currency and transportation (Schmitz, 2012).</p>

            <p><b>Language training</b> is a possible topic that may be needed for any assignment. Although English is
                regarded
                as the language used for business internationally, the other aspect of language training falls to body
                language and small habits that are normal in parent countries that could be considered disrespectful in
                host countries. Understanding and learning these non-verbal forms of communication can allow an
                expatriate to adapt faster and build better relationships with the HCNs (Schmitz, 2012).</p>

            <p><b>Assignment training</b> would be a major topic that must be taught as this will allow the expatriate
                to fully
                understand the goals and expectations of the assignment. Not only will it allow the expatriate to manage
                the work correctly, but will also allow the expatriate to be successful in their final delivery
                (Schmitz, 2012).</p>

            <p><b>Personal management training</b> is training the expatriate to be able to cope with stress, feeling
                homesick,
                culture shock, or even workload management. The pressures from the new environment and work can impact
                not only the expatriate but the expatriate&rsquo;s family as well. By ensuring that not only the
                expatriate but the family as well is able to manage the stress of expatriation will allow the employee
                to reduce the amount of personal stress in their life and manage the assignment better, leading to
                success (Schmitz, 2012).</p>
            <h3 class="w3-center">4.2.3. Expatriate Management</h3>
            <p>Over and above preparing the expatriates for their assignment through the various training topics,
                expatriate management includes the constant support of the expatriates during their assignment.
                Providing the constant support throughout the assignment will contribute to the overall success of the
                assignment. The support is dependent on the assignment itself, based on its timeline and requirements,
                and this can be discussed during pre-departure training (Morris, 2020).</p>

            <p>Expatriate management includes constant contact with the expatriate through various channels. This could
                be through an employee in the parent country itself or even previous expatriates. The knowledge sharing
                and feedback of positive experiences can allow the expatriate to feel less lonely and cut-off. Besides
                communication, ensuring that the expatriate is covered by adequate healthcare and an emergency contact
                can make managing the expatriate an easier task (Morris, 2020).</p>

            <p>Prior to departure, the expatriate must be engaged with to agree on a fair compensation package to ensure
                willingness of the employee considering the costs of visa sponsorships, housing and allowances. In
                conjunction to this, an adequate repatriation package must be created and agreed upon to not only
                incentivise the employee to return to the parent country offices, but to aid in the readjustment of the
                expatriate and their family. Lastly, expatriate management should include post-assignment discussions
                whereby the expatriate can give constructive feedback to allow the company to better manage future
                expatriation of employees (Morris, 2020).</p>
            <h3 class="w3-center">4.2.4. Analysis of another MNC</h3>
            <p>Cisco Systems Inc., founded in California in 1984 began creating and producing routers and has quickly
                risen to be a leader in the computer networking industry, becoming a constantly nominated and
                award-winning company specifically recognised by Great Place to Work &reg;. Over the last decade, Cisco
                has expanded their operations across the globe into more than 165 countries, allowing and creating a
                diverse staff through equal opportunities (Chen, 2017).</p>

            <p>In an attempt to obtain better results, Cisco paid more attention to defining the company&rsquo;s goals
                and direction, with that understanding how to measure its progress, especially appraising
                employee&rsquo;s performance. This allows employees to set out their performance goals for the year,
                define their work, and measure against their goals. As a reward to meeting or exceeding one&rsquo;s
                goals, Cisco is able to compensate their employees in monetary or non-monetary ways which include
                performance-based pay; extra leave; stock purchasing options; and even flexible work practices. These
                rewards are over and above the wages agreed upon between the employee and Cisco (Chen, 2017).</p>

            <p>Although Cisco does offer its employees rewards and incentives for better performance and results, the
                company does pride themselves in equal and fair culture. Through various mergers and acquisitions, Cisco
                looks to further diversify their culture by hiring more local talent and incorporating diversity into
                their leadership team. This allows Cisco to have a more geocentric approach, ensuring that human
                resources are utilised to the maximum while constantly innovating and allowing the company to maintain a
                competitive advantage (Chen, 2017).</p>

            <p>The geocentric approach, where employees are hired based on suitability and not nationality, allows Cisco
                to be a company open to anyone of any nationality. The company does allow for expatriate management, as
                seen by Cisco employee Matthew Ingram. Mr Ingram has worked at Cisco since 2015, and since then has been
                encouraged to use the company&rsquo;s technology to work remotely supporting his wife&rsquo;s career
                aspirations of being a travelling nurse (Ingram, 2019). Another example is seen in India, where Cisco
                expatriate employees are primarily from four places, Europe, Singapore, Beijing and USA. The cultural
                orientation during the pre-departure training includes a language course of 160 hours, depending on the
                individual&rsquo;s needs (Biswas, 2007).</p>

            <h1 class="w3-center">5. Recommendations and Conclusions</h1>
            <h2 class="w3-center">5.1. Recommendations</h2>
            <p>Tesla&rsquo;s internationalisation plans by opening a factory in Shanghai would be an incredibly welcomed
                one to the company and the country itself. While the company&rsquo;s current HR policies are somewhat
                informal, the prospect of international subsidiaries should indicate a need for a more defined HR policy
                that can be defined for the companies outside of USA. This would ensure that the Tesla&rsquo;s brand is
                protected but continually successful in foreign countries.</p>

            <p>Tesla&rsquo;s current management of human resources does allow for innovation and challenges all levels
                of management; however, the company could benefit from adapting similar HRM practices from a company
                such as Cisco. By creating subsidiaries across the globe, Tesla can change their recruitment approach to
                be geocentric as opposed to a polycentric approach or in the case of China an ethnocentric approach. The
                benefit of changing the HR practice to be more geocentric would allow Tesla to maintain their level of
                innovation but have a greater impact on their competitors on a global scale.</p>

            <p>Tesla should ensure that a well-constructed and thoroughly researched training programme is put in place
                for any expatriates that will be sent on assignment for the company. The definition of this training
                will determine the success of the internationalisation of Tesla. These expatriates can then be given the
                opportunity to train host country nationals to become leaders in the subsidiary company and continue to
                adapt and lead the company to have and maintain a better competitive advantage within that country
                respectively.</p>

            <p>In conjunction with expatriate training, Tesla should ensure that any and all recruitments done for host
                country nationals and even third country nationals are done through a reputable, highly informed and
                expertly trained HR department or company. The better the understanding and training of the HR
                department, the more refined and well-selected host country nationals will be employed for the company.
            </p>
            <h2 class="w3-center">5.2. Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Tesla is the world leader in aesthetically pleasing electric vehicles, currently 100th on the Fortune 500
                list, the company is a leader in the electric vehicle and a fierce competitor in the automotive
                industry. The company&rsquo;s plan to internationalise themselves by building a factory in Shanghai is
                the first Gigafactory built outside of the United States. The company has many opportunities available
                to them with regards to their internationalisation plans, however it brings with it many threats.
                Although its HR policies are unique and somewhat informal, it allows Tesla to easily adapt these
                policies to conform to host country laws and regulations. According to Hofstede&rsquo;s cultural
                dimensions, many differences exist between USA and China with the individualism vs. collectivism having
                the greatest difference. The company has various options in recruiting host country nationals, and given
                the HR policies, the behavioural leadership theory would be best suited for Tesla as it would allow
                employees to more collaborative, innovative and give the company a competitive advantage.</p>

            <p>The report looked into Tesla&rsquo;s plans for internationalisation through building its factory in
                Shanghai, analysing various HRM and IHRM practices and its impact on the company. An environmental
                analysis was done on the company and any challenges that were likely to be faced were analysed on how it
                would affect the HRM practice within Tesla. The HRM policies are critically reviewed and discussed on
                how they would enable Tesla to overcome any challenges faced. Recruitment strategies are investigated
                and an analysis was done on the selection of expatriates and host country nationals. This was taken
                further and the expatriate training was discussed and the relevant areas of expatriate management. Cisco
                System Inc. were used as an MNC to understand and analyse their IHRM best practices with the focus on
                compensation and performance management of expatriates. Lastly, recommendations are given for Tesla for
                their internationalisation and adaption of HRM practices.</p>
