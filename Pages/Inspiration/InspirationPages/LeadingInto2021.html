                    <p class="w3-center">28/01/2021</p>

                    <hr style="width:60%; margin: auto;" class="w3-opacity">

                    <p>2020 was rough. Let us not deny it. 2020 was probably a year we all want to forget. It was probably one
                        of the most challenging years for any of us. And now, we are in the 21st year of the 21st
                        century&hellip; a brand new year. But how are we defining it? Are we calling this year 202(won)
                        because of the way it kicked our asses? Or are we going to say, this year, this new year, we will define
                        it as 202I won.</p>
                    <p>People, January is almost done and we&rsquo;re going into this year full steam ahead. Vaccine rollouts
                        are underway, the world has fully adjusted to remote working and the USA has a new captain at the helm.
                        And although this may seem positive and the best is yet to come, we cannot be too certain about that. We
                        do not know what the future holds for us, and there is no way we can be insouciant. This battle we are
                        fighting right now against COVID is testing the leaders of the world, and like any battle, we look to
                        our leaders in times of need, but what if I say you can be your own leader. Be a leader to yourself and
                        those around you. Raise your hands if you consider yourself a leader, in any regard.</p>
                    <p>Now if I had to ask you to describe yourself as a leader, what would you say? How would you define your
                        leadership style? There are 8 distinct leadership styles, and none of us will ever be identified as a
                        sole style, but rather some styles being more dominant than the others. But like everything in life, we
                        can always adapt, learn and improve on the skills that will allow us to be the leaders I know we all
                        are.</p>
                    <p>The first type of leader is the Bureaucratic leader, these are the rule enforces, whose decisions are
                        absolute, motivates discipline, demands immediate compliance and engages in top-down interactions. This
                        type of leader cannot lead highly skilled individuals or as we know them as high-performance teams. The
                        bureaucrats are best when a decision must be made in a short time, one of the most well-known
                        bureaucratic leaders is Sir Winston Churchill.</p>
                    <p>The next type of leader is the Authoritative leaders. These leaders give us long-term direction and keep
                        us focused on the end goals, generally having more knowledge than those they lead, and motivates the
                        team by making everyone more enthusiastic while setting standards and giving a clear direction. These
                        authoritative leaders are most effective when a change of direction or vision is needed however they are
                        not as effective when explicit guidance is required. Once again, under this style one name stands above
                        all, Bill Gates.</p>
                    <p>Our third type is the Innovative leaders. These are the people sharing the vision of the future, always
                        pursuing excellence, constantly encouraging innovation, promoting respect for creativity, and desiring
                        collaborative conversations. Nevertheless, these leaders aren&rsquo;t the risk takers and yet are those
                        best for solving the complex problems. Without a doubt, the world&rsquo;s richest man is an innovative
                        leader, Mr Jeff Bezos.</p>
                    <p>The fourth type is the Pacesetting leaders, those who embrace new projects, and move with speed. Their
                        focus is productivity, setting high standards of performance and doing so in true Thuma Mina fashion, by
                        leading by example, however, these leaders don&rsquo;t feel the need to communicate a lot of detailed
                        instructions to their team, and over long-periods of time can become ineffective, but this team is made
                        up of the self-motivated and highly skilled members. Virat Kohli is a prime example of a pacesetting
                        leader evident with the introduction of his fitness revolution to the Indian Cricket Team.</p>
                    <p>The Democratic leaders are those who rely on the consensus decision-making, allowing others to
                        occasionally take the lead, encouraging participation and collaboration. But, when time is limited, and
                        the team may not have the right expertise, the democratic style of leadership hinders. Nonetheless, when
                        the knowledge of the entire team is needed to solve a problem or find direction, the democrats succeed,
                        such as Indra Nooyi, the CEO and chairman of PepsiCo.</p>
                    <p>The sixth type, the Affiliative leader has the goal of creating a harmonious team, focusing on emotional
                        needs thus creating positive personal relationships and avoiding conflicts. This style is less effective
                        in giving negative feedback however they are great in increasing morale, repairing broken trust and
                        working through high stress situations. Joe Torre, the ex-manager of the New York Yankees was an
                        affiliative leader, constantly spoken about today.</p>
                    <p>The penultimate type is the Coaching leader, who as you probably have guessed, prepares individuals for
                        the future by skill building, finding the hidden potential by challenging the individual and constantly
                        communicates with positive statements. Those fearful of change struggle with the coach, however the
                        one[1]on-one setting will always thrive under the coaching style, as did Mahatma Gandhi.</p>
                    <p>The last type of leader is the Altruistic leader, who personalizes the approaches for individuals in the
                        team, leading in order to serve others, motivating by empowering their team, and shows great empathy and
                        commitment to building community. In the short run, an altruistic leader may be ineffective however,
                        time permitting can create a positive culture and promote high morale such as Mother Theresa.</p>
                    <p>Now I can imagine that this bombardment of information is making you sit in your chair, wondering to
                        yourself what is your most dominant leadership style. Maybe you&rsquo;re democratic, maybe altruistic,
                        hell I thought I was more authoritative than anything else, and yet that is my least dominant style.
                        Apparently, my most dominant traits come from the innovative and pacesetting styles with my
                        authoritative and democratic being my least dominant. Those who know me may well agree with that, or
                        some may be shaking their heads saying, Kish you are nowhere near that.</p>
                    <p>Look at the end of the day, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what type of leader you are, which is your stronger
                        suit and which is your weaker. We can all adapt, learn and improve to become the best leaders we can be,
                        especially in these times of such uncertainty. I know that every single one of you sitting here is a
                        powerful leader in your own right. In all honesty, in my opinion, to be a great leader, just don&rsquo;t
                        be a dick&hellip;tator.</p>
