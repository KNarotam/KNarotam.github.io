                <h2>God of War Review</h2>
                    <p class="w3-center">29/04/2018</p>

                    <hr style="width:60%; margin: auto;" class="w3-opacity">

                    <p>
                        I have just finished this game and I cannot find the words to write this review. People … I apologize
                        if this review is not up to my normal, crazy standards … but I cannot express how urgent of a need it is
                        to play this game. Listen to me, scrape every cent, do your bully’s homework or your crush’s … do
                        whatever
                        it takes to get a PS4 and this game, because this game was so spectacular, I will give you the rating
                        right here… right now.<br><br>
                        10/10 … no wait … 11/10 … wait … PERFECT … no god dammit … I cannot find the words to express or a
                        relevant score to give this game because my mind is still absolutely blown.
                        Yes, JoKishler is back … and this is probably the greatest review I have ever written for
                        the greatest game I have ever played … and I have played A LOT!
        
                    </p>
        
                    <h2>God of Which Religion?</h2>
                    <p>He is the God of War. Kratos, the Ghost of Sparta is back sporting a sexy beard (#teambeard), a new
                        weapon, the Leviathan Axe and a boy … I mean a son, but he calls Atreus boy so many times in the game, I
                        thought I would do the same. I can’t pull it off can I?<br><br>
                        With his shield on his arm, an axe better than Mjolnir, as it an axe that comes back to your hand … yes
                        freaking awesome and his son Atreus with a bow and arrow. Kratos has moved to the land of Norse
                        mythology. Odin’s realm, and sorry people, this is the real Odin, not the one Marvel portray in their
                        movies. Following the events of God of War III, embark on a journey of Kratos and Atreus exploring the 9
                        realms of the world growing with them, emotionally, spiritually and mentally. This game has without a
                        doubt the BEST character development I have seen in my life.
                        With twists and turns, and sudden realization at the end of the storyline … I cannot and will not say
                        any more about this game because I feel every person on this earth should experience this game.
                    </p>
        
                    <h2>God of Combat</h2>
                    <p>Moving on to the minor things that make a game awesome … let’s talk about the gameplay. With an open
                        world sandbox, God of War is an RPG game with the player controlling Kratos and commanding Atreus to
                        fire when needed. You can customize Kratos with upgrades of armour, runes and improving his weapons, the
                        game brings about a more personal feel to Kratos rather than the previous hack and slash vibe and
                        destroying every single freaking God in the Greek mythology. Finding better armours and recipes,
                        experiencing the nine realms anyway you would like, and solving intricate puzzle this game is a true
                        definition of an RPG.<br><br>
                        Now let’s talk weapons, the Leviathan Axe is the best … throwing it directly to a draugr’s face,
                        freezing it a bit and recalling it and watching as the axe splits the enemy’s head open is just so damn
                        satisfying. Having Atreus shoot arrows at multitude of enemies to distract them, or even having him jump
                        on their backs and holding them, while you charge up a heavy attack and dig your axe into their shoulder
                        and decapitate the hell out of a dead guy… Santa Monica Studio nailed the combat of this game.
                    </p>
        
                    <h2>God of Perfection</h2>
                    <p>And no flaws are to be seen. I have to admit, the coolest thing about this game is that from the minute
                        you select start a new game … you are in the game … you do not encounter a loading screen … unless you
                        die. Santa Monica studios have a genius way of loading the world and the map for the continuation of the
                        game. Take hints, game developers … this is how you make a game.
                        I find myself trying to find words for this review, and truthfully I am struggling. I’m pretty sure you
                        can see, but if reading my other reviews and knowing me, and knowing I never am at a loss for words… it
                        should be damn well clear how epic this game was.
                        Now back to this review … besides the action, the killing, the story, the gameplay … the music is
                        absolutely phenomenal. And before the game was released, the soundtrack was released on Spotify … and
                        now that Spotify is available in SA, people check it out. You won’t be disappointed.
                    </p>
        
                    <h2>God of Results</h2>
                    <p>I cannot stress how much and how amazing this game was. From its character development to its story line,
                        to every plot twist and fighting combat sequence … Santa Monica Studio’s God of War is the greatest game
                        that has been released this year … and yes it is a valid Game of the Year contender.<br>
                        As I said it before … I cannot fault this game … nothing I want to change, only the fact that I wish I
                        could erase my memory and play it again as if it was the first time.
                    </p>
