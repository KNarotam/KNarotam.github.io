                <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
                <p>Apple Inc. is fourth on the Fortune 500 list, and is an industry leader in the technology industry. The
                    company is valued at over $2 trillion, and their mission and organisational objectives are presented and
                    explained how aligned they are. An analysis was done on the company&rsquo;s existing operations and
                    quality management processes which include the <em>Products</em>, <em>Services</em>, <em>Markets and
                        Distribution</em>, <em>Supply of Components</em> and <em>Research and Development</em>. The analysis
                    continues using operations management tools such as flowcharts, control charts, FMEA and Six Sigma to
                    explore how Apple utilises these tools in two different scenarios. The current Information Management
                    Systems are explored and how these operations have affects any of the business operations. An AI
                    analysis was done detailing how Apple uses AI to enhance their overall business operations from both an
                    internal and value-add view, lastly giving recommendations on improving existing business operations.

                <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                <p>Currently fourth on the Fortune 500 list, Apple Inc., commonly referred to as Apple, is one of the
                    world&rsquo;s most recognised and respected brands and a leader in the technology industry. Apple was
                    founded and created in 1976 as the brain child of Steven Jobs and Stephen Wozniak, with its first
                    standalone computer, known as the <em>Apple II</em>, being released and sold in 1977&nbsp;(Levy, 2021).
                    Since then, Apple has quickly risen to become a market leader in the industry, currently having a market
                    value of more than <em>$2 trillion</em>.</p>
    
                <p>Apple&rsquo;s mission statement defines their purpose as a company &ldquo;committed to bringing the best
                    user experience to its customers through its innovate hardware, software and services&rdquo; (Apple Inc,
                    2018). This mission statement defines Apple&rsquo;s business strategy in which they leverage their
                    &ldquo;unique ability to design and develop its own operating systems, hardware, application software
                    and services to provide its customers products and solutions with innovative design, superior
                    ease-of-use and seamless integration.&rdquo; The strategy further supports the community for any
                    offerings &ndash; software, hardware and digital content &ndash; that aligns with Apple. Furthermore,
                    expanding the brand through company-owned retail and online stores as well as a distribution network
                    including third-parties; and investing within itself for research, development, marketing and
                    advertising, forms part of Apple&rsquo;s business strategy and organizational objectives.&nbsp;(Apple
                    Inc, 2018).</p>
    
                <p>Ultimately, there are two elements that define Apple&rsquo;s purpose: user experience and innovation;
                    both of which aligned to achieve the business strategy defined by the organisational objectives which is
                    further extended down into the company&rsquo;s operational and quality processes. The first of the
                    operational processes is the <strong>Products</strong> where a new version of the product is released
                    year on year, utilising Apple&rsquo;s own updated software and latest hardware. The second process is
                    the <strong>Services</strong> which is catered to their customers from a support and digital offering
                    perspective that includes advertising and various forms of digital content. <strong>Markets and
                        Distribution</strong> is the third process that allows Apple to broaden their reach within the
                    domestic and global market and build various partnerships with many third-parties to aid in the
                    distribution and marketing of all Apple products and services. <strong>Supply of Components</strong> is
                    the process that ensures all components utilised in the creation of any products are available and
                    created for Apple&rsquo;s products that allow the company to deliver quality products. Lastly,
                    <strong>Research and Development</strong> ensures that the company will always adapt to any changes in
                    the industry, to remain competitive by developing and building new technology, subsequently improving
                    current products and services offered (Apple Inc., 2020).</p>
    
                <h2>2. Existing Operations and Quality Management</h2>
                <p>Apple&rsquo;s success in the technology industry was the result of their branding, products and ingenuity
                    in industry itself. Jeffery L. Cruikshank studied Apple&rsquo;s management and defined <em>The Apple
                        Way</em> into four categories that focus on: the product, the customer, marketing, and leadership
                    (Cruikshank, 2005). This focus aligns to Apple&rsquo;s vision and mission of making exceptional product
                    and can be seen in all of their operations and quality management processes.</p>
    
                <h3>2.1. Decision Areas of Operations Management</h3>
                <p>The 10 decision areas of operations management can dictate the success or failure of a company if not
                    managed correctly. Apple is an example of how managing these 10 decision areas can lead a company to
                    success. The company has an allocated team of senior managers, each of which are dedicated to handling
                    the implementation of the measures addressing the 10 decisions areas which are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Design of Goods and Services</li>
                    <li>Quality Management</li>
                    <li>Process and Capacity Design</li>
                    <li>Location Strategy</li>
                    <li>Layout Design and Strategy</li>
                    <li>Job Design and Human Resources</li>
                    <li>Supply Chain Management</li>
                    <li>Inventory Management</li>
                    <li>Scheduling</li>
                    <li>Maintenance.</li>
                </ol>
    
                <p>Each of these areas are managed in a way that aligns to Apple&rsquo;s vision and mission statements. For
                    example, Location Strategy and Layout Design and Strategy is a selective process when choosing a
                    location and depending on that location, what would a customer expect in a store of that calibre. Every
                    one of these decisions in operation management are considered very carefully before any implementation
                    occurs, which is why Apple has been successful and will continue to be successful in the industry
                    (Rowland, 2019).</p>
    
                <h3>2.2. Products</h3>
                <p>Apple&rsquo;s line of products include their line of smartphones: the <em>iPhone&reg;</em>; the personal
                    computers: the <em>Mac&reg;</em> which are both desktop and laptops; the multi-purpose tablets: the
                    <em>iPad&reg;</em> range; wearable technology: the <em>Apple Watch</em>; the audio product range:
                    <em>AirPods&reg;</em> and any of the products in the <em>Beats&reg;</em> range; home and streaming
                    devices: <em>Apple TV &reg;</em> and <em>HomePod&reg;</em>; and Apple&rsquo;s virtual assistant
                    <em>Siri&reg;</em> (Apple Inc., 2020). From a software perspective, each one these products, those that
                    require an operating system, all execute and run Apple&rsquo;s various operating systems that Apple have
                    developed and continuously updated to bring consumers a constant stream of improvements and features.
                    Apple&rsquo;s new range of devices always include new hardware such as better and faster processors,
                    improved cameras and storage capabilities, higher resolution screens, etc. The constant release of new
                    smartphones, tablets and personal computers year-on-year align to Apple&rsquo;s business strategy of
                    designing and developing their own software, hardware, operating systems etc.</p>
    
                <p>According to their last published fiscal results, Apple&rsquo;s <em>iPhone</em> had decreased by 3% in
                    2020 due to no new model being introduced into the market. Going forward, with the release of the iPhone
                    12 and its variations in 2021, Apple should be on board to improve on these sales. The <em>Mac</em>
                    sales had increased by 11% due to their new laptop, as well as their <em>iPad</em> sales increasing by
                    the same amount. <em>AirPods</em> and the new <em>Apple Watch</em> had increased the sales of the
                    Wearables, Home and Accessories division by 16% (Apple Inc., 2020). It can be seen that year-on-year
                    Apple&rsquo;s sales continually increase, and a larger increase is seen in years when Apple introduce
                    newer products in their product line. Based on their current organisational operations and processes,
                    Apple will continue to grow in a sustainable manner as long they continue to innovate their products and
                    constantly utilise and develop the latest technology. This introduction and continued innovation will
                    allow Apple to mitigate their risk of the constant introduction of new technology and its application to
                    Apple products (Apple Inc., 2020).</p>
    
                <h3>2.3. Services</h3>
                <p>The services operations within Apple cater not only to the company but the customer as well. These
                    operations form part of quality management processes as well. The first of the services that are offered
                    is the advertising that Apple use to not only boost the company itself but it includes arrangements with
                    numerous third-parties that will utilise the Apple advertising platform. The <em>Cloud Services</em> are
                    part of the offerings that Apple provides for the customers that not only allows for customers to store
                    data on the cloud but allows all of the products owned by customers to receive the most recent content
                    across multiple platforms. Apple also provides <em>Payment Services</em> which include their cashless
                    payment and branded credit card. The <em>Digital Content</em> is the large umbrella that works on
                    multiple platforms that allows customers to download and use various applications and access and use
                    digital content such as electronic books, music, media, gaming and podcast content. These work alongside
                    a subscription-based service that is offered to the customers across the various platforms and works
                    hand-in-hand with third-party developers to create and publish the various content. The last service
                    offered is <em>AppleCare</em> which is the fee-based service and support catered to customers from a
                    quality management perspective. This allows customers to gain support from the company for technical
                    matters, both software or hardware related as well as coverage similar to that of insurance (Apple Inc.,
                    2020).</p>
    
                <p>Over the last fiscal year, the Services operations saw a 16% increase, with a constant growth projected.
                    Apple&rsquo;s agreement with multiple third-parties will allow the company to maintain customer loyalty
                    while increasing the offerings provided through any of their products and services offered through the
                    agreements with various third parties. By continuing agreements with multiple third-parties to utilise
                    the various platforms that Apple services provide as well as continuously improving the platforms
                    themselves; Apple can sustain their growth of the business through their services operations, allowing
                    them to mitigate the risks identified with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This sustainable growth would
                    also mitigate the dependency on various third-parties that provide products, services and content to
                    Apple who form a major part of Apple&rsquo;s financial success (Apple Inc., 2020).</p>
    
                <h3>2.4. Markets and Distribution</h3>
                <p>As described in the book <em>The Apple Way</em>, category two is focused holistically on the customer
                    (Cruikshank, 2005). Given the products and services provided by Apple, the customers range from the
                    general consumer market to businesses of all sizes, including the education sector as well as the
                    government. Apple is able to bring their products and services as well as other third-party products to
                    market and directly to the customer through multiple distribution channels that include their own
                    physical stores, an online store and multiple third-party businesses. These include network carries,
                    various wholesaler, retailer and even verified reseller stores (Apple Inc., 2020).</p>
    
                <p>The rise of the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the company in multiple ways, forcing many of the stores
                    to close and all staff to work remotely from home. While this has been handled successfully, Apple still
                    has a dependency on network carriers, wholesaler, retailer and reseller stores to continue managing the
                    operations (Apple Inc., 2020). By maintaining their platforms and agreements, the company can
                    potentially mitigate this risk by constantly monitoring global and regional markets as well as the
                    pandemic. This will allow Apple and their relevant third-parties to maintain a successful marketing and
                    distribution network that would ensure continued growth and success (Apple Inc., 2020).</p>
    
                <h3>2.5. Supply of Components</h3>
                <p>In order for Apple to develop and create their products, the company requires essential components that
                    are available from multiple sources with some being sourced from limited vendors. Given the
                    hypercompetitive environment in the technology industry, Apple competes with multiple rivals over
                    components, that creates a major dependency on the component, its respective suppliers and the market
                    itself. However, some components that allow Apple to maintain a competitive advantage over their
                    competitors are custom and are generally available from a singular source. Depending on how new the
                    technology is, this component may be subject to limited supply and supplier constraints. Although Apple
                    has agreements with all their suppliers, there is no guarantee of any extension, renewal or
                    similar-termed agreements with the suppliers. This does create a dependency risk for the company on
                    these suppliers. Along with this, the company outsources all hardware related components, located
                    primarily within the Asian continent (Apple Inc., 2020).</p>
    
                <p>These two risks could be mitigated by ensuring that Apple has the correct agreements in place with all
                    suppliers as well as identifying potential alternatives for some components; which could result in a
                    much less scarcity issue arising with regards to any and all components. Apple could also continue to
                    create more custom components which will allow them to become more innovative, and remain competitive in
                    the market itself.</p>
    
                <h3>2.6. Research and Development</h3>
                <p>Like many technology companies, research and development play a vital role in a technology
                    company&rsquo;s ability to stay relevant, competitive and successful. Apple&rsquo;s research and
                    development operations are constantly adapting, testing and utilising the latest in technology. In doing
                    so in a continuous and timeous manner, Apple is able to maintain a competitive advantage in all their
                    products and services. Research and development also include intellectual property and licensing it such
                    that it can be offered as a service through their digital content. Furthermore, this entails Apple
                    acquiring third-party businesses and subsequently the corresponding technology that will allow Apple to
                    utilise it within their own operational and quality management processes (Apple Inc., 2020).</p>
    
                <p>Over the last 5 years, Apple has increased their research and development expenses by 86%, using 2% more
                    of their total net sales from 2018 to 2020 (Apple Inc, 2018) (Apple Inc., 2020). The constant investment
                    within the company itself has increased the costing requirements, however it has allowed Apple to
                    maintain a strong competitive advantage in the market and remain a business constantly improving in both
                    technology and value provided.</p>
    
                <h2>3. Operations Management Tool Analysis</h2>
                <p>Evaluating how various operations management tools contribute to the success of Apple&rsquo;s
                    organizational objectives will be done using two scenarios:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The creation and development of a new product.</li>
                    <li>The testing of reliability and safety of products.</li>
                </ul>
    
                <h3>3.1. Flow Charts</h3>
                <p>Flow charts, or process flow diagrams, present a sequential and logical order of steps within a process.
                    Primarily used to describe how a specific process flows, define the steps and order of steps, time
                    frames, decisions and dependencies (ASQ, n.d.). Using the creation and development of a new product,
                    Apple does this in a specific manner as depicted in Figure 1.</p>

                <figcaption class="w3-center">Fig.1 - High Level Process Flow of Product Creation and Development (Kahney,
                    2019)</figcaption>
    
                <p>As seen in Figure 1, the process is a very high-level view of how a product at Apple moves from inception
                    to manufacturing. As per Apple&rsquo;s core value, Steve Jobs had ensured that when a product is being
                    created, it begins with the Industrial engineers, in the design stage. New products and ideas are
                    designed and prototypes are made during the first three stages which is made up of the Industrial Design
                    team; the Product Design team consisting of electrical and mechanical engineers and Device Software
                    group; and the Operations team (Rowland, 2019).</p>
    
                <p>Once the team is happy with the prototype, the process moves onto the Product Design, whereby the various
                    electrical and mechanical engineers work to ensure all necessary components can fit within the design
                    itself, also known as Packing the Suitcase. While the Product Design is working on the design of the
                    internal components, the Operations team begins to evaluate the product and begins assessing how the new
                    product and its introduction will affect the current supply chain, in conjunction with planning how the
                    product will be catered for mass production (Rowland, 2019).</p>
    
                <p>By including Operations in the design early into the process, will allow the team to constantly adhere to
                    the limitations of what can and what cannot be mass produced. Operations begins to manage the tools,
                    fixtures and develop the process for the production of the product. This involves designing the parts
                    that are crucial to the manufacturing dedicated to specific components of the product, such as the
                    battery. Once approved, Operations take over completely and begin to scale the manufacturing process on
                    a global scale monitoring where and how the cost can be reduced in all areas (Rowland, 2019).</p>
    
                <h3>3.2. Control Charts</h3>
                <p>Control charts are plotted points of data that allow the user to study how a process changes over time
                    within set threshold limits. These charts can aid in identifying and correcting various problems as they
                    occur, determining whether the process (in this case product) is stable and testing quality (ASQ, n.d.).
                    For Apple, the scenario of testing the reliability and safety of their products will be used.</p>
    
                <p>Within the Apple operations exists two dedicated engineering groups, called Reliability and Safety. These
                    teams perform multiple, often exhaustive tests on the various products; with the focus of the test being
                    on the extreme conditions. For example, <em>AirPods</em> are placed into synthetic sweat and this is
                    done to simulate the gym environment and how well would the product itself survive in these
                    environments. Given the highly unlikely, yet possible scenarios, such as dropping the laptop on solid
                    concrete or a phone in a urinal; these sorts of tests are done so to evaluate the product&rsquo;s
                    quality in extreme conditions (Rowland, 2019).</p>
    
                <p>Apple can utilise control charts to monitor the data and progress of their products being able to
                    estimate potential lifespan of products, and how should business evaluate and cater their services
                    provided through <em>AppleCare</em>. With testing in this manner, the Reliability and Safety teams must
                    have proposed solutions as problem arises, which could be unknown until testing such as this is done
                    (Rowland, 2019).</p>
    
                <h3>3.3. FMEA</h3>
                <p>The Failure Mode and Effect Analysis is a tool that is used across multiple industries as part of the
                    Lean Six Sigma methodology, that allows a team to identify potential problems and its impact that could
                    arise after the production and analyse and address them in the development stage (Forrest, n.d.).
                    Continuing with the testing of reliability and safety scenario, Apple can utilise FMEA to analyse and
                    identify potential issues that could arise with the new iPhone scheduled to release later in the year.
                    Table 1 presents an example of FMEA for this scenario.</p>

                <h3>3.4. Six Sigma</h3>
                <p>The Six Sigma approach was initially developed in the late 1980s by Motorola, with the goal to eliminate
                    errors by improving the systems that handled quality and measurement. While Six Sigma is focused on
                    constant improvement of value for the customer based on their experience, it makes it a useful tool for
                    Apple to use as it treats the customer as king. Although similar to Lean Manufacturing, Six
                    Sigma&rsquo;s approach is to look at variation and performance (GoSkills, n.d.). Using the first
                    scenario of creating and developing a new product, specifically an iPhone, Apple can use the five phases
                    of the Six Sigma in developing a new <em>iPhone</em>, seen in Figure 2.</p>

                <figcaption class="w3-center">Fig.2 - Five Phases of Six Sigma (DMAIC) (GoSkills, n.d.)</figcaption>
    
                <p>Apple needs to release the next generation of the <em>iPhone</em>, using the latest technology and
                    addressing all customer concerns. In order to understand the problem, Apple can receive feedback from
                    customers on what would be desired in the next iteration of the <em>iPhone</em>. For example, customers
                    may request a better or more camera options; customers have found that the battery life could be
                    improved; Apple&rsquo;s phones do not have the capability to &ldquo;fast-charge&rdquo; their phones
                    unlike their competitors; the screen glass cracks too easily. Using this type of feedback from
                    customers, will allow Apple to define their problem, and begin to design and implement a better
                    smartphone.</p>
    
                <h4>3.4.1. Define</h4>
                <p>Now knowing what the customer requires in the next iteration of the smartphone, Apple can now measure its
                    current performance and what is currently happening from a customer experience point of view. This will
                    allow Apple to see the true measurements of their current generation of <em>iPhone</em>s and will be
                    able to create and set baseline values that can be compared to. This is done to ensure that the new
                    product will be improved or not.</p>
    
                <h4>3.4.2. Measure</h4>
                <p>Now knowing what the customer requires in the next iteration of the smartphone, Apple can now measure its
                    current performance and what is currently happening from a customer experience point of view. This will
                    allow Apple to see the true measurements of their current generation of iPhones and will be able to
                    create and set baseline values that can be compared to. This is done to ensure that the new product will
                    be improved or not.</p>
    
                <h4>3.4.3. Analyse</h4>
                <p>Using the current data that Apple has gathered and currently has, the team can now begin to analyse the
                    data by identifying where and how performance is currently being hindered. A thorough analysis must be
                    done as the goal is not to simply analyse and identify where the problem is, but rather identify,
                    analyse and resolve the root cause of a problem. For example, battery life could not be performing as
                    desired because of an excessive use of mobile applications, so by analysing, the team can determine that
                    use of less applications will create a longer lasting battery. However, this does not identify the root
                    cause of the problem, as smartphones are constantly being used, and so an investigation and analysis
                    must be done on which mobile applications are causing battery degradation and look at catering for this.
                </p>
    
                <h4>3.4.4. Improve</h4>
                <p>Once the root causes of all variations have been identified, the team can now begin to plan and design
                    the necessary improvements required. These changes must then be tested and the team must ensure that any
                    and all changes made are resolving the problems identified and defined in the first phase.</p>
    
                <h4>3.4.5. Control</h4>
                <p>In the final phase, the changes made must be implemented and by doing so has a ripple effect on all
                    systems required to develop and make the changes. This is done so in a sustainable manner and with
                    continued monitoring, the team can determine if all the changes and improvements made are still being
                    realised.</p>
    
                <h2>4. Management Information System (MIS) Analysis</h2>
                <p>Management Information Systems form the backbone of an organization&rsquo;s operations consisting of
                    software and hardware; constantly analysing data, reporting on it and ultimately aiding in making
                    decisions (Shopify, n.d.). Apple&rsquo;s major types of information systems are presented in Figure 3.
                </p>

                <figcaption class="w3-center">Fig.3 - Apple's Major Information Systems (Barzani & Nabaz, 2020)</figcaption>
    
                <h3>4.1. Transaction Processing Systems</h3>
                <p>TPS is defined as information that monitors transactional data and transforms that into a database
                    system. This type of system is key when running an online store (Barzani &amp; Nabaz, 2020).
                    Apple&rsquo;s Market and Distribution operations include their own online retail store as well, and
                    utilising a system like TPS allows Apple to track online sales of any products. Given the COVID-19
                    pandemic, and multiple stores being forced to close, Apple still saw an increase in sales of their
                    products, which could indicate the use of the online platform in purchasing the products. The gross
                    margin of the products increased from $68.887 billion in 2019, to a gross margin of $69.461 billion in
                    2020 (Apple Inc., 2020).</p>
    
                <h3>4.2. Office Automation Systems</h3>
                <p>The Office Automation Systems are those that enable all employees of Apple to utilise personal computers
                    and systems to perform business activities. For example, all computers present within the Apple
                    headquarters in California, granting all employees access to the necessary information (Barzani &amp;
                    Nabaz, 2020). With majority of the workforce being forced to work from home and remotely, this system
                    has extended into the cloud, allowing the employees to work remotely while still achieving objectives
                    and adding value to the customers.</p>
    
                <h3>4.3. Knowledge Work Systems</h3>
                <p>The Knowledge Work System acts like a library for the employees of Apple. This allows all members of the
                    company to learn from others with different skillsets, on how to perform various tasks and complete
                    objectives. It assists the company in knowledge sharing and knowledge organisation while allowing team
                    members to upskill themselves without any cost to company (Barzani &amp; Nabaz, 2020).</p>
    
                <h3>4.4. Management Information Systems</h3>
                <p>The MIS system in this case is more of a process, which begins with searching for information, storing
                    the information, monitoring and identifying conflicts and issues and developing solutions for any that
                    arise. In the case for Apple, the MIS is used for customer satisfaction (Barzani &amp; Nabaz, 2020).
                    With customer experience being the focal point of Apple&rsquo;s mission and vision, the use of an MIS
                    allows the company to maintain a positive customer satisfaction score by addressing any and all concerns
                    experienced by the customers. This system would form the backbone of Apple&rsquo;s growing success.
                    Year-on-year, Apple increases their spending in the R&amp;D operations of their company, with a 16%
                    increase from 2019 to 2020 (Apple Inc., 2020).</p>
    
                <h3>4.5. Decision Support Systems</h3>
                <p>By collecting data, analysing it and reporting it in more readable and understandable format, the
                    Decision Support System assists the necessary stakeholders in decision making situations and scenarios
                    (Barzani &amp; Nabaz, 2020). The use of these systems has become vital in a company such as Apple, as
                    decisions made by management can ultimately affect the company itself in terms of value and earnings.
                </p>
    
                <h3>4.6. Expert Systems</h3>
                <p>Expert Systems are one of the most complex ones as they contain elements of AI in its use. Expert Systems
                    are those that are used to simulate human reasoning, analysing and identifying patterns and create
                    reasoning with them. Apple uses the company &ldquo;NEXPERT&rdquo;, who are responsible for developing AI
                    applications, specifically in the financial payment world (Lozano, et al., 2016). The use of the Expert
                    System allows Apple to extend their operations and services that are offered to their customers, in this
                    case the use of <em>ApplePay</em>.</p>
                <h3>4.7. Overall Analysis</h3>
                <p>Apple being a leader in the technology industry, indicates that they utilise their Information Systems to
                    the maximise by investing more and more into research and development. The constant and increasing
                    investment in research and development has allowed Apple to develop more products in their range making
                    them better and allowing them to maintain a commanding presence in the market itself. The use of the
                    systems, whether it is for decision making, production, or upskilling, has allowed Apple to increase
                    their revenue over the last year regardless of the COVID-19 pandemic from $98.392 billion in 2019 to
                    $104.956 billion in 2020 (Apple Inc., 2020).</p>
    
                <h2>5. AI Analysis</h2>
                <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being implemented more and more in the world today in all industries to
                    help gain a competitive advantage of competitors or assist in many business operations within the
                    company itself. Apple does use AI in numerous ways both in an internal perspective, but more within the
                    products that they produce, i.e. affecting the Services operations of the business in what is being
                    offered. The virtual assistant Siri is the most notable form of AI that Apple has, making it a desirable
                    feature in all of Apple&rsquo;s products as it can be utilised with all products offered in perfect
                    synchronisation.</p>
    
                <p>Over the years, Apple has continued to develop Siri from a basic question and answer programme to one
                    where it is able to identify callers not on your contact list; or predict the next application you may
                    open based on what you have done before; or even presenting a map location based on reservations you
                    have made. Apple&rsquo;s AI has evolved from just Siri to each product having their own &ldquo;Apple
                    brain&rdquo; inside each of the products. The use of the various AI tools and techniques such as machine
                    learning, deep learning and neural networks are constantly running on any of the products and being
                    constantly utilised to aid the user in everyday tasks, such as detecting if a person is currently
                    exercising due to an increase in their heart rate (Levy, 2016).</p>
    
                <p>Apple&rsquo;s development in AI has aligned to their organisational objective of creating a much more
                    user-friendly and personalised user experience. But this does not only include software on the
                    smartphones and tablets but goes further into the actual hardware. The research and rapid development of
                    AI in the products, have given rise to more innovate components being used to enable more machine
                    learning techniques to be used (Levy, 2016).</p>
    
                <p>The machine learning experts within the company do not only focus on implementing various algorithms on
                    the products and services alone, but rather are used throughout the entire company. The machine learning
                    teams are encouraged to work with other teams within the company to help solve other problems and even
                    play an important role in idea creation. Although experts are found within the company, many of those
                    that utilise the machine learning and AI have no experience in it and have been upskilled to utilise it
                    in any of their business operations (Levy, 2016).</p>
    
                <p>Although Apple uses AI to its benefit, unlike their competitors, they do not disclose any of their
                    research to the public, however they counter this disadvantage by purchasing small companies and
                    increasing their manpower. This allows Apple to maintain a competitive advantage against all their
                    competitors by utilising the skillset of the smaller companies and developing more advanced versions of
                    their AI, that would not have been possible at any earlier stage (Levy, 2016).</p>
    
                <p>The major concern that faces Apple and it&rsquo;s AI is around data privacy. Although encrypted, the data
                    that is given and used by the team is not the complete set of data involving user&rsquo;s personal data.
                    The first question that is asked is what happens to the information used in training and developing the
                    neural network? The second question asks how can a neural network be developed and trained to predict
                    behaviour without know personal user information? Apple has addressed both concerns utilising their
                    product as a whole, i.e. both software and hardware. The highly personal information is stored locally
                    on the device itself, thus not exposing it to any other forms of data leaks. The second concern is
                    addressed by analysing how users utilise their own device. For example, based on the number of times a
                    person opens an application and in what order is it opened is all calculated and trained in the neural
                    network to predict the probability of that application being the next one the person decides to use. It
                    can also be seen in analysing typing patterns and words used, which is how predictive text works on any
                    of the Apple devices (Levy, 2016).</p>
    
                <p>Ultimately, Apple is able to address challenges that AI places on them by developing and training the
                    various neural networks, deep learning and machine learning algorithms on the device itself, protecting
                    users&rsquo; privacy.</p>
    
                <h2>6. Recommendations and Conclusion</h2>
    
                <h3>6.1. Recommendations</h3>
                <p>Apple is constantly improving their operations and quality of products delivered to all their customers.
                    By focusing on the customer experience and aligning all operations to the organisational objectives,
                    Apple has continued to succeed in the technology industry maintaining a strong market share and
                    competitive advantage. In order for Apple to maintain their current growth, it could be suggested that
                    Apple continues to innovate all products and services in a more aggressive manner utilising more recent
                    and experimental technology.</p>
    
                <p>Apple could continue innovating by creating more custom components used in their products to allow them
                    to gain a bigger competitive advantage over competitors. It could also be recommended that Apple
                    considers publishing research to the public like their competitors. Given the dependency of multiple
                    third-party developers; Apple&rsquo;s aggressive corporate approach of buying smaller companies that
                    utilise AI in other ways; Apple publishing their research could invite more third-party developers to be
                    more innovative giving Apple a much larger competitive advantage.</p>
    
                <p>Apple&rsquo;s ongoing and growing investment into research and development increases all
                    headcount-related expenses. The company could utilise their existing AI team that develops machine
                    learning, deep learning and neural network algorithms and align the team to the research and
                    development. By utilising the various forms of AI, the company can begin to continue to innovate and
                    improve on the research and development of all operations, while reducing the constantly increasing
                    headcount expenses.</p>
    
                <h3>6.2. Conclusion</h3>
                <p>Apple is fourth on the Fortune 500 list, and a leader in the technology industry, with their
                    organisational objectives being aligned to their mission statement. The company&rsquo;s operations and
                    quality management processes were divided into five major categories, namely, their Products, which
                    group all their devices and wearables together; their Services, by which they focus on digital content,
                    support, value-add and licensing services offered to various third-parties and customers; their Markets
                    and Distribution, where Apple focuses on selling their product and services through various channels;
                    the Supply of Components, in which they use to develop their innovative products; and research and
                    development, whereby they constant ensure the company adapts to the rapidly changing industry and
                    environment.</p>
    
                <p>The report looked into four operations management tools and how they are used within Apple&rsquo;s
                    operations from a scenario perspective. The tools used for the analysis included: flowcharts, control
                    charts, FMEA and Six Sigma. The company&rsquo;s Information System was analysed and explained, looking
                    at how each of these systems contributed to increasing Apple&rsquo;s gross margin to $104.956 billion,
                    even throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. An analysis was done on AI and how it is used to enhance
                    Apple&rsquo;s operations including their products and services and how any challenges faced were
                    addressed. Lastly, recommendations are given to Apple on how to remain an industry leader and maintain
                    the competitive advantage while benefitting the business and not impacting any existing operations. </p>
