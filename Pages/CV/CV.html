                        <p style="font-size: 120%;">Kishan came across technically strong and well experienced, and he
                            asked
                            questions that were relevant to the processes being audited.
                            He worked very well with no supervision from the Internal Audit Team.
                            His turnaround time was always very quick, which was also notable by Senior Clover
                            Management.
                            He produced exceptional high-quality work, with additional value add which was also notable
                            to the client.

                        <p style="font-size: 120%;">He was very mindful of the budget and contributed to the good margin
                            that was
                            achieved overall on the entire account.
                            He prepared adequately for the meetings (opening, status updates, clarification and close
                            out meetings),
                            which he was able to chair and in certain cases answer
                            difficult technical questions from Finance/IT specialist.
                            Client queries and additional requests were addressed timeously by Kishan and always made
                            himself
                            available.
                            Internal Team status updates were provided by him before even being requested from him.

                            He managed to build very strong relationships with Clover Senior Management, within a very
                            short space of
                            time.
                            He reported on his deliverable's way before the set deadlines.
                            He also embraces and lives EY values, as evidenced by the below noted observed strengths.

                            external. He
                            was
                            able to complete all allocated work within and often , ahead of the timelines set. He was
                            always willing
                            to
                            assist other project team members, where they needed and was generous to offer this help
                            frequently. He
                            was
                            able to comprehend the work needed to be done and carried that out. It must be said that

                            were often ambiguous and lacking historical reference points. He asked questions where
                            needed and sought
                            clarification where uncertainty prevailed.<br>
