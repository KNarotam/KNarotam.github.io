                <h2>Deathloop Review</h2>
                    <p class="w3-center">29/10/2021</p>

                    <hr style="width:60%; margin: auto;" class="w3-opacity">

                    <p>
                        Hey Arkane Studios, give me one order of Dishonored, with a side of 1960s, a dash of timelooping, and an
                        intriguing premise. That’s exactly what we got with Arkane’s latest development Deathloop. That’s right
                        people, after a while JoKishler is back with a review for Deathloop. “If at first you don’t succeed,
                        die, die again.”
                    </p>
        
                    <h2>Death-Defying Story</h2>
                    <p>Set in the 1960s, on Blackreef island, you take on the role of Colt Vahn, a bad ass motherfucker with no
                        memory of what happened, why is someone is hunting him, why the same day keeps repeating, or what the
                        hell are his particular set of skills. The story follows Colt and his countless attempts to break the
                        loop of this day. While uncovering the reasons for his wacky version of Groundhog Day (if you don’t know
                        this, Google it, and if you had to Google it … well I’m disowning you), but back to the game. Colt
                        uncovers the secrets behind the program that put them there, who are the main people in charge of this
                        program, and how can he put a stop to it.</p>
        
                    <p>Blackreef is a beautifully weird island, with 4 locations that can be explored as you see fit. Playable
                        at 4 distinct times of day, each area on Blackreef is filled with information, secrets, enemies and an
                        ever-changing environment. And last but not least, the 7 visionaries that need to be hunted, while at
                        the same time being hunted yourself. Deathloop’s environment, ways of executing your targets leave the
                        player with multiple ways to explore, with twists and turns and each loop over, this game is going to
                        keep you coming back!</p>
        
                    <h2>Death From All Angles</h2>
                    <p>Combined with a beautiful environment and attention detail, Deathloop’s combat is simple, effective and
                        tonnes of fun. With a style and power similar to that of Dishonored, the way you play and kill is all up
                        to you. If you want to go gang-ho on the enemies, that stock up your guns, choose your charms, get your
                        powers ready and go nuts. Or if you’re like me play stealth, and sneak behind and whack them assassin
                        style. Either way, Deathloop leaves the option up to you.</p>
        
                    <p>The weapons are limited, but as the rarity increases, so do some of their abilities like causing
                        bleeding, or slowing health-regen and blah blah blah. And from the power point … well this was a bit of
                        an annoyance for me. You have a choice of 7 slabs that each grant you some pretty epic abilities. But
                        anytime you go out to explore, you’re only choosing 2. Now I found myself using the Shift and Nexus
                        slabs a lot. Shift, obviously like Dishonored, gets you to places. Nexus, well what happens to one
                        enemy, affects others if they’re linked. With telekinesis style power, invisibility, and the ability to
                        rewind a little time after you die being available each time you go out, Colt’s ability to be a badass
                        is limited by your playstyle.</p>
        
                    <h2>Death-looping Back</h2>
                    <p>Now as time went on, and the story began to unfold, I found myself being able to assassinate and plan all
                        7 visionaries in a single loop become progressively easier and fun, with the trick being how to group
                        some together and giving them the old whack! I won’t lie about midway through, I found myself killing
                        visionaries over and over, to a point where some that were alone, I ended up knowing how to do it
                        blindfolded. But counterpoint, I started finding more fun ways to kill them, using their own turrets
                        against them, or a trip mine, or even grabbing my sword and just straight up running at them and gutting
                        them. Each time I had more fun, and each time it got easier. And once the plan comes together, that
                        final run of the loop is incredibly fun, knowing where they are, how to kill them, and actually
                        executing them reached a great peak. HOWEVER … I found the ending a tad bit … well plain. With 3
                        possible endings, the “good” ending that I got was a bit anti-climactic. The others leave more to hope
                        for, and actually potential for a sequel.</p>
        
                    <h2>Death to the Loop</h2>
                    <p>Arkane’s latest development and exploration into a timeloop game is probably one of the best implemented.
                        With a great story line, excellent environment, twist and turns, and the ability to play to your style,
                        leaves the game highly recommendable and tonnes of fun. The combat is simple, but gives you the chance
                        to try multiple variations and styles, and you can play to your style, limited by your creativity … and
                        well the bounds of the game. If you liked Dishonored’s style, then you will definitely love Deathloop,
                        especially in a 60s environment.</p>
