                It’s that time of year again where EA, after hyping up the fans for something that is barely changed
                year on year, release their bread and butter. The latest edition of FIFA. FIFA 21. What can I say that
                isn’t described in the title of the article? Honestly, what can I say?</p>

            <p> With minor changes in the gameplay, a new added feature in manager mode and a similar Volta story with a
                short campaign, EA’s FIFA 21 is not something to shout about. Hell, fans of the series have been bombing
                Metacritic with shocking reviews it was sitting at a casual 1.1 User score, but at the time of writing
                this
                it is at an all time LOW of 0.8! Can someone say, “What the actual fuck is wrong with you EA?”</p>

            <h2 class="w3-center"><b>Same Shit, Different Skin</b></h2>
            <p>When I had written the FIFA 18 review I was blown away by the epic changes and improvements to the
                dribbling, the new interactive mode called “The Journey”, it was all just a proper game changer. But
                this
                year. Holy crap, you’re only paying for updated kits, a slightly darker UI, oh and back to only 1 pair
                of
                commentators. Yes, that’s right, goodbye Martin Tyler and Alan Smith and the same commentary you had in
                the
                previous games. All that we are left with is Derek Rae and Lee Dixon. And their commentary is completely
                …
                completely … identical to FIFA 20.
                EA have done nothing to revolutionise FIFA 21, shit it might even be worse. Have you seen some of the
                character mapping in this game?? Mason Greenwood looks like Craig from Halo Infinite to me, Carlo
                Ancelotti
                looks like a fat, low resolution version of himself, and it is just shockingly bad. EA! Listen to me
                bud,
                take a seat and listen. You want to make small changes to the game to make fans a little happier?
                Character
                map more managers, youth players or wait … here is a big one. ADD MORE NAMES TO THE COMMENTARY LIST!!!
                You
                have had the same names for so long, dinosaurs still roamed the Earth.</p>

            <h2 class="w3-center"><b>Park the Bus and a Last-Minute Goal</b></h2>
            <p>Everybody is giving this game a hiding of a review, even I am to a point, but the question should be is
                there any saving grace for this game? For me there is maybe a few things, but for the most part it
                honestly
                feels like they took FIFA 20 code, copied, pasted and updated the kits.
                But anyways, a nifty addition to Manager mode, is the ability to jump into a simulated game and play for
                a
                bit is quite enjoyable. You can truly simulate and see if your built dream team can perform well and
                when
                you control them can they handle the true pressure? Along with this, you can create a development plan
                for
                your players to change their role and cater them to your play style and your needs.
                That said, FIFA catalogue seems to have disappeared and no longer can you get a 70% financial takeover
                or a
                “+5 Overall” to your player in the respective career modes. It seems that all of that is gone like EA’s
                screws in their head. The removal of the “+5 Overall” in the Player Career mode is welcomed to a point,
                but
                the dumbest thing I’ve seen, is that in the Manager mode you can request a financial takeover of up to
                500,000,000. Yes, half a billion. So basically, instead of building the team from scratch, and working
                for
                the cash, take the money, buy Messi, Mbappe, Dybala, Ronaldo and freaking Van Dijk and win, over and
                over
                and over and over again. Fun right?</p>

            <h2 class="w3-center"><b>Just a Terrible Day at the Office</b></h2>
            <p>Overall FIFA 21 is FIFA 20 with Mbappe on the cover, a repeated Volta story, a minor cool feature here
                and
                there, and new kits. FIFA 21 for the Nintendo Switch was a carbon copy to FIFA 20 and when IGN reviewed
                it
                and saw that, they gave the exact same review for FIFA 20 with a lower score of 2.<br>
                Look at the end of the day, I don’t know why me and a bunch of FIFA hungry fools buy this game year on
                year,
                when we know nothing is going to change. Guess we are the suckers while EA sits with all the cash. If
                you’re
                a FIFA fan, you’re still going to enjoy FUT and Pro Clubs and all that shit, and maybe that’s why some
                of
                the reviews are looking half decent, but in my opinion, it’s nothing to shout about. The bugs are
                undeniable
                and the gameplay is the same. Yippee!</p>
