                <p class="w3-center">Written: 22/10/2021</p>
                <hr style="width:60%; margin: auto;" class="w3-opacity">

                <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
                <p><em>Namshi.com</em> was founded in 2004 by Muhammed Mekki and Faraz Khalid, and has since grown into the
                    Middle East&rsquo;s leading fashion e-commerce business and is currently owned by Emaar Properties PJSC.
                    It was seen that analytics in the e-commerce industry was allowing firms around the globe to become
                    increasingly competitive and give companies a major competitive advantage. Including these analytics at
                    <em>Namshi.com</em> is discussed, identifying various applications of analytics and how they could
                    benefit the company in its implementation. The current issues experience in analytics is explored, with
                    the focus being on the four V&rsquo;s of big data and data security and privacy being the most prominent
                    issues faced. Subsequently, utilising analytics for evidence-based decision-making was discussed for
                    <em>Namshi.com</em> including how big data analytics can impact the fashion industry. The Acito &amp;
                    Khatri structural framework for business analytics is suggested as the framework to be introduced into
                    <em>Namshi.com</em> to introduce and build the analytical capabilities in the company. The various types
                    and sources of data that the organisation can use is explored giving use cases for each, while supply
                    chain analytics is discussed in detail for an e-commerce firm and how it can used to optimise the
                    overall supply chain. A discussion of web and social media analytics is given with the focus on how it
                    can be used to engage with customers is presented alongside a business challenge around the website and
                    product layout and how it would in turn affect sales. The solution to the challenge identified was to
                    implement customer journey and the Laws of UX with analytics to optimise the process, understand the
                    customer, and increase sales. Lastly, recommendations are given on how <em>Namshi.com</em> can improve
                    their analytical capabilities and remain competitive in the industry.</p>
    
                <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                <p>In 2004, Muhammed Mekki and Faraz Khalid saw a gap in the Middle East online retailer market,
                    specifically for fashion. Together they took this opportunity to create <em>Namshi.com</em>, a fashion
                    e-commerce store similar to that of <em>Zappos</em> in the USA, ultimately looking at how they could tap
                    into the retail sector which contributes to 30% of Dubai&rsquo;s GDP (Knowledge@Wharton, 2012). Over the
                    years, <em>Namshi.com</em> has continuously increased their sales over the past 5 years, and are
                    projected to continue their increase over the next few years, currently owned by Emaar Properties PJSC,
                    <em>Namshi.com</em> remains the number one online store in the UAE and continues to be an industry
                    leader in the Middle East (ecommerceDB, n.d.).</p>
    
                <h3>1.1. Analytics in E-Commerce</h3>
                <p>The e-commerce industry in the Middle East, specifically in the Gulf region has seen a major growth in
                    the industry over the last two years. These developing countries have seen a gradual shift in e-commerce
                    from the traditional brick-and-mortar models, with a 19.3% increase in market size since 2014. The
                    e-commerce industry has seen this increase due to advancements in technology such as smartphone
                    advancements, an increase in the use and speed of internet in the region, among various initiatives
                    supporting e-commerce including initiatives, establishing hubs to work with local and international
                    companies, and further adapting to the Fourth Industrial Revolution of adopting the digital
                    transformation (Mehta &amp; Bhandari, 2018).</p>
                <p>Analytics has become a fundamental, core competency of any e-commerce firm, adopting significantly large
                    amounts of data, both structured and unstructured, resulting in the industry being the one of the
                    fastest adopters of big data analytics (BDA). On a business level BDA is being used to allow the firm to
                    use the insights to lead strategies, make significant business decisions, and allow firms to gain a
                    competitive advantage in their industry. On a customer level, BDA is giving firms an opportunity to
                    identify new opportunities, personalise the customer experience, ultimately relating analytics in
                    e-commerce to a combination of business processes, emotional connection, and the optimisation of
                    technology (Akter &amp; Fosso Wamba, 2016).</p>
                <p>Furthermore, BDA provides unprecedented value to the respective firms by expanding the capabilities of
                    the firm. The capabilities of e-commerce through analytics, specifically big data analytics can include:
                    personalisation, which has been seen to increase customer loyalty and sales; dynamic pricing to allow
                    firms to remain competitive; customer service whereby analysing how to retain customers and monitor
                    customer value can be done; the end-to-end supply chain, where improvements and monitoring can be done;
                    security and fraud detection to keep customers safe; and predicative analytics aiding in taking the firm
                    into a sustainable future&nbsp;(Akter &amp; Fosso Wamba, 2016).</p>
    
                <h3>1.2. Analytics at Namshi</h3>
                <p>With analytics and BDA becoming a core competency of many e-commerce firms, <em>Namshi.com</em> could
                    stand to drastically benefit from utilising it. It was seen that companies that prioritised data
                    analytics, focusing on being more data-driven saw an improved performance in financial and operational
                    matters, ultimately having those in the top 33% of their respective industry being more productive by 5%
                    and more profitable by 6% (McAfee &amp; Brynjolfsson, 2012). Although <em>Namshi.com </em>is the number
                    one e-commerce firm in the fashion sector, it is merely regarded as a notable store compared to its
                    competitors, specifically the top four e-commerce firms in the Middle East, which are:
                    <em>Amazon.ae</em>, <em>Noon</em>, <em>Souq</em>, and <em>Wadi</em>. All of these e-commerce stores
                    launched after <em>Namshi.com</em> however are rated higher due to their similar design and feel to that
                    of Amazon (Lundt, 2020). In order for <em>Namshi.com</em> to be regarded as a fierce competitor to all
                    e-commerce firms in the Middle East, they should look for ways to apply BDA and analytics. Table 1
                    presents <em>Namshi.com</em> with various ways in which analytics can help the business improve.</p>

                <h2>2. Literature Review</h2>
    
                <h3>2.1. Current Issues in Analytics</h3>
                <p>Although analytics add tremendous value to e-commerce firms, there are multiple challenges that the firms
                    need to deal with. One of the challenges is employee buy-in for big data, where it is seen that managers
                    are posed with multiple challenges in getting their frontline workers to understand and trust the big
                    data provided to them. This potentially stems down to either lack of knowledge of the capabilities of
                    model being used for the big data or lack of trust in the model itself. This was overcome by presenting
                    the data itself in a readable format which includes creating functional dashboards, reports, and
                    visualisations. This leads to greater challenges of training the managers and relevant employees in
                    adopting the big data (Akter &amp; Fosso Wamba, 2016).</p>
                <p>Subsequently, this leads to challenge of dealing with the sheer amount of data that is being collected
                    and analysed for the business. Large datasets are difficult to manage and can pose major issues when
                    presenting analytics in real-time (Li, 2020). These large datasets further pose a challenge for the
                    analysts as distinguishing relevant and irrelevant data becomes a timeous task as the dataset increases
                    in size (Bottles, et al., 2014). In conjunction to this, data quality is key to ensuring that there is
                    value added to the organisation through the analytics provided. The challenge of data quality lies in
                    the databases, applications, and storage used in the business, however if not maintained correctly or
                    even as a result of large data, should redundancies occur, it could drastically affect the
                    decision-making process. This aggregates to data governance and the challenges within it for big data
                    analytics (Akter &amp; Fosso Wamba, 2016).</p>
                <p>One of the biggest challenges is data privacy and data security and how exactly is this handled by the
                    organisation. This includes utilising data with consent of the customer through the organisation&rsquo;s
                    &ldquo;terms of use&rdquo;. Through social media and registering for e-commerce sites, personal data is
                    constant being shared, and the introduction into biometric data is creates more concern and challenges
                    (Akter &amp; Fosso Wamba, 2016). Coupled with this is the challenge of verifying the customer on the
                    site through online identity verification. While it can be implemented in a multitude of ways, ensuring
                    that the customer is who they say they are, is crucial in protecting the customer and they brand of the
                    business itself (Team Vue.ai, 2020).</p>
                <p>Many e-commerce systems are built on top of multiple systems, generally termed a smart e-commerce system.
                    These systems have the challenge of interoperability, whereby the underlying systems are supervised by
                    various teams that utilise alternating infrastructure from cloud to physical systems. Furthermore, the
                    various supervisory teams have a specific skillset, background, and culture; creating a further
                    challenge for the organisation. Due to the various interoperability issues, e-commerce businesses may
                    find it challenging to analyse their systems and operations (Song, et al., 2019).</p>
                <p>In addition, e-commerce challenges extend to customers involving customer experience, customer loyalty,
                    being able to take a potential customer to a paying customer, and even finding the correct customer.
                    Customer experience challenges the e-commerce design and presentation, dictating the ease of the
                    customer journey, whereas customer loyalty looks at how to retain customers, reduce churn and increase
                    their purchase power. The conversion of a customer to a paying customer is one of the biggest challenges
                    experienced in e-commerce firms as multiple factors come into play such as: website traffic, erratic
                    browsing, lack of interest, and even lack of personalisation. Lastly, identifying the target market and
                    further identifying the right customer is a challenge constantly being experienced, as it involves being
                    the prevalent choice over e-commerce competitors and brick-and-mortar stores, areas of shipping, and
                    shipping costs (Team Vue.ai, 2020).</p>
    
                <h3>2.2. Using Data for Evidence Based Business Decision Making</h3>
                <p>Companies that have defined themselves as data-driven saw improvements in their productivity and
                    profitability by 5% and 6% respectively. Furthermore, it was seen that these data-driven
                    businesses&rsquo; performance remained unhindered after accounting for the investment in IT, capital,
                    labour, and purchased services ultimately leading to increases in its respective stock market valuation
                    (McAfee &amp; Brynjolfsson, 2012).</p>
                <p>Although <em>Namshi.com</em> is an e-commerce firm for fashion, the company could utilise data and
                    analytics to feed innovation in the business. It can be seen that by incorporating the understanding of
                    data and analytics at every level to each role in the business saw drastic improvements in innovation
                    throughout the various areas in which analytics are used such as customer experience, marketing and
                    sales, corporate strategy, and developing new products and services (Marshall, et al., 2015).</p>
                <p>Analytics and data can be used in supply chain management of the firm, by implementing various strategies
                    and models, <em>Namshi.com</em> could drastically improve their overall business. It was seen that firms
                    that implement and utilise big data at various points of their supply chain gained a competitive
                    advantage. Further, application of big data analytics into logistics saw companies identify and address
                    major issues within their business relating to delivery, and were able to identify ways of reducing the
                    cost of operating and methods of delivering their product in an eco-friendlier way. In conjunction to
                    this, research was done on the correlation between the rise in numbers of internet users and effects on
                    big data and supply chain management. It was seen that the human factor was the major dependency on the
                    improvement of big data and supply chain management (Samuel, et al., 2018).</p>
                <p><em>Namshi.com</em> can utilise data and analytics to impact their reach by implementing data-driven
                    marketing. With the use of data-driven marketing, results can be shown objectively, historic data can be
                    analysed and future trends could be modelled and predicted. This further extends to using customer
                    behaviour data to fully understand and implement effective marketing strategies. The impact of
                    data-driven marketing can improve business by identifying and reaching more customers similar to current
                    customers, prevent existing customers from churning, use the Pareto principle to identify the services
                    that produce the relevant investment returns, improve customer loyalty, personalise marketing and
                    seasonal campaigns, and improve current product offerings (Terneva, n.d.).</p>
                <p>Data and analytics can also be used to aid customers in their purchase through recommendation systems and
                    to ensure customer safety through fraud detection. The focus on the customer is a choice used by many
                    e-commerce firms, where customer-specific data is constantly being utilised and mined such as
                    behavioural, transactional, and customer service to be able to offer a personalised experience and
                    ensure that the customer returns. eBay uses data analytics to identify areas of opportunity to gain a
                    competitive advantage by using the data and working hand-in-hand with their most loyal and largest
                    customers and sellers (Ferguson, 2013).</p>
                <p>Acharya et al. interviewed professionals of all levels involved in the fashion industry and their
                    findings saw that if firms utilise their big data, it assists in creating and co-creating a strong
                    knowledge base which influences evidence-based decision-making. It was seen that the sharing of
                    knowledge occurred rather in the middle levels of the organisation and enabled managers to effectively
                    manage their inventory and sale price and added value to the business (Acharya, et al., 2018).</p>
    
                <h2>3. Implementation of the Analytics Program</h2>
    
                <h3>3.1. Using the Acito & Khatri Framework</h3>
                <p>Although <em>Namshi.com</em> is the leading fashion e-commerce organisation in the Middle East and ranked
                    451<sup>st</sup> globally, the organisation could stand to become a prominent figure in the overall
                    e-commerce industry in the Middle East (ecommerceDB, n.d.). In order to align the company&rsquo;s
                    strategic goals and analytical capabilities, the Acito &amp; Khatri structural framework for business
                    analytics should be the preferred choice. Figure 1 displays the framework designed by Acito &amp;
                    Khatri.</p>
                <img src="/Images/Strategy/Namshi/Figure1.jpg" style="width:100%;" alt="Figure 1">
                <figcaption class="w3-center">Fig.1 - Acito & Khatri Structural Framework for Business Analytics (Acito &
                    Khatri, 2014)</figcaption>
                <p>With <strong>data</strong> being the foundation of the framework, as business analytics is defined as
                    leveraging the value or insights from the data itself. The use of this framework will allow
                    <em>Namshi.com</em> to utilise the data and acquire valuable insights and align these insights to the
                    business strategy, corporate culture and behaviours, performance management, and analytical tasks and
                    capabilities of the business itself (Acito &amp; Khatri, 2014).</p>
                <p>The <strong>strategy</strong> is the business&rsquo;s plan of action on how they use their resources to
                    be successful, sustainable, and profitable for the next few years. It looks at answering questions such
                    as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Who are the target customers?</li>
                    <li>What are the products we can offer our customers?</li>
                    <li>How do we work within the current market?</li>
                    <li>What or where is our competitive advantage?</li>
                    <li>How can we optimise our current way of working or processes?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Identifying and asking the questions can help the organisation define the strategy and in turn can define
                    the data that will be required for analytics (Acito &amp; Khatri, 2014).</p>
                <p>The <strong>desirable behaviours</strong> are defined internally in the company, by their culture,
                    beliefs, corporate value. Generally defined by the vision and mission statements, ways of work, and
                    corporate structure; these factors play a role in how the organisation and the employees value the
                    insights derived from the analytics, and how these insights contribute to the business
                    decision-making&nbsp;(Acito &amp; Khatri, 2014).</p>
                <p><strong>Business performance management </strong>focuses on multiple aspects of the supply chain, but
                    looks to answer two questions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How can the performance of the business be measured?</li>
                    <li>What determines business performance? (Acito &amp; Khatri, 2014)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In data-drive organisations, analytical <strong>tasks</strong> are broken into three distinct categories
                    of: producing the insights, consuming the insights, and enabling the creation of the insights. Produce
                    is the process from sourcing the data to analysing to creating the insights, done by the analysts.
                    Consuming the insights is done by those who utilise the insights to make the business decisions.
                    Enabling is the general technical aspects that allow the analyst to produce their insights (Acito &amp;
                    Khatri, 2014).</p>
                <p>With technology being the enabler and supporter, the <strong>capabilities</strong> are dividing into
                    three types: decision, analytic, and information. The decision capability are the tools that support how
                    the insights are delivered, such as reports and dashboards. The analytic capability identifies with
                    methodologies, toolkits including models, statistics, descriptive, predictive, prescriptive analytics.
                    Lastly, the information capability is defined as the technology used to organise, share, integrate, and
                    describe data assets (Acito &amp; Khatri, 2014).</p>
    
                <h3>3.2. Identifying the Sources of Business Data</h3>
                <p>Data in e-commerce transitions towards big data, and as a result conforms to the four V&rsquo;s of big
                    data: volume, velocity, veracity, and variety. Volume speaks to the sheer amount of data that is
                    collected. Velocity is how often data is generated and delivered, or the speed of the data generated and
                    collected. Veracity refers to the quality of data that is going to be analysed. Variety refers to the
                    different types of data that will be generated and used (Akter &amp; Fosso Wamba, 2016).</p>
                <p>The sources of data for e-commerce can range and each can be utilised in specific use-cases, Table 2
                    presents a table summarising the main types of e-commerce data, various sources of the data, and use
                    cases of the data itself.</p>

                <h3>3.3. Supply Chain Analytics</h3>
                <p>E-commerce firms have a general linear flow in terms of their respective supply chain, which can be seen
                    in Figure 2. This linear flow is the simplest way of analysing the supply chain and engaging in supply
                    chain analytics. While analytics is possible in all stages of the supply chain, from an e-commerce
                    perspective, the analytics that the business has control over is in the <em>Inbound (Procurement),
                        Fulfilment (Production), and Returns (Consumer)</em> stages (Murray, 2020).</p>

                <h4>Inbound (Procurement)</h4>
                <p>There are a multitude of metrics leading to analytical capabilities present in the <em>inbound</em>
                    stage, while not as linear as the others, the focus of this stage converges to the availability of the
                    product to the customers. Table 3 presents various metrics, descriptions, and relevant measurements
                    taken to build the analytics in this stage (Murray, 2020)</p>

                <h4>Inventory</h4>
                <p>Inventory management is crucial in supply chain management as it dictates multiple business decisions
                    such as price, customer expectations, customer satisfaction, as well as supplier relationship
                    management. The analytics of inventory management is structured around data science, where analysts are
                    able to predict and forecast the supply and demand of certain product, considering the various data
                    aspects such as seasonality, marketing campaigns, promotional sales, etc. (Murray, 2020).</p>
                <h4>Fulfilment (Production)</h4>
                <p>The <em>fulfilment</em> stage is the final stage in the business before handing over to the delivery
                    partner company. The measurements and optimisation of this stage is linear and could see drastic
                    improvements from the use of analytics. Table 4 presents the metrics, descriptions, and measurements of
                    the fulfilment stage (Murray, 2020)</p>

                <p>Similar to the <em>inbound</em> stage, unless owned by the organisation themselves, the <em>outbound</em>
                    stage is less controllable and optimised if a delivery partner is being used. However, certain metrics
                    can be measured in order to find the optimal time, process, and method of delivery to the
                    customers&nbsp;(Murray, 2020).</p>
                <h4>Returns (Consumer)</h4>
                <p>The <em>returns</em> stage is also defined as reverse logistics whereby companies are able to utilise
                    specific data collected from customers and look at ways at improving the overall customer experience.
                    For example, the e-commerce firm could ask the reasons for returning a product to aid in identifying
                    potential issues, areas of concern, and create a risk mitigation plan (Murray, 2020).</p>
    
                <h3>3.4. Critical Analysis in Web and Social Media Analytics</h3>
                <p>Over the past decade, social media has evolved from a simple form of online interaction to a core
                    capability of most businesses today. Approximately 3.5 billion users are active on social media, with a
                    new account being created every 6.4 seconds. In conjunction to this, an average user has approximately
                    7.6 social media accounts spending nearly two and half hours on it per day (Alemdar, 2021). Utilising
                    social media analytics can reap multiple benefits for <em>Namshi.com</em> as it can drastically improve
                    customer engagement which in turn can improve the organisational strategy and business itself.</p>
                <p>Utilising social media analytics can allow analysts to understand the customers. This extends to looking
                    at data such as time of posting and history of posts to improve marketing. By monitoring specific times,
                    <em>Namshi.com</em> will be able to publish specific marketing posts which would receive the maximum
                    number of viewers, driving more traffic to the website, resulting in potentially new sales. In
                    conjunction to this, understanding which social media platforms work for which products allows the
                    company to market specifically to customers in a personalised manner, in turn ensuring that the company
                    produces better content on the various platforms. Social media analytics can go further in
                    understanding, analysing, and finding opportunities by analysing competitor data, ensuring that
                    <em>Namshi.com</em> remains competitive and maintains their competitive advantage. From a marketing
                    perspective, social media analytics will allow the marketing team to better refine their strategy,
                    eliminating mistakes, optimising the performance and process, and leading to a larger customer base
                    (Quantzig, 2019).</p>
                <p>Improving customer engagement through social media can also be done by dedicating a team to the various
                    platforms. By having a dedicated team, the customers are guaranteed swift and consistent assistance,
                    increasing customer loyalty and brand perception. Subsequently, responses from the customers can be
                    categorised using text analysis, to understand sentiment, consensus, and identify areas of improvement
                    (Wenzl, 2021).</p>
                <p>Web analytics on the other hand can generate a wealth of information for most teams within the business.
                    Web analytics grants the organisation the ability to monitor how the website is being used, the traffic
                    present, the customers that are visiting the website, both old and new. Utilising various web analytic
                    techniques such as clustering, classification, association, path analysis, and sequential pattern gives
                    <em>Namshi.com</em> a multitude of benefits such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Recommending current and available products to customer interests</li>
                    <li>Improving customer experience</li>
                    <li>Performing target resource management</li>
                    <li>Testing the content relevancy and architecture of the website.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The benefits further extend to business applications such as targeted, personalised marketing campaigns,
                    effective management of customer base, improved customer service, and ability to predict customer
                    behaviour (Alghalith, 2015).</p>
    
                <h2>4. Business Challenge</h2>
                <p>When developing an e-commerce website, there are a multitude of factors that must be considered before
                    engaging with customers. Factors such as user experience, user design, competitor analysis, and customer
                    journeys must be considered as this will dictate the success of the website. In order to address the
                    challenge posed by the team, two aspects must be considered, namely user experience (UX) design and
                    customer behaviour and journey.</p>
                <p>Addressing the UX design perspective can be done various ways, one of which is understanding the
                    psychology behind digital products and services in order to design better user interfaces. Jon Yablonski
                    defined these laws of UX across four distinct categories:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Heuristic</li>
                    <li>Principle</li>
                    <li>Gestalt</li>
                    <li>Cognitive bias.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Table 5 presents a description of the laws of UX defined by Jon Yablonski (Yablonski, 2020)</p>

                <p>The UX can also be analysed and measured quantitatively and qualitatively. Quantitative data includes
                    customer satisfaction, net promoter score, and customer effort score. This data can be collected through
                    the use of on-site surveys, pop-up widgets, heatmaps to understand where users are interacting with the
                    website. The analysis done on quantitative data will allow business to understand what the various
                    metrics and measures that determine the success of the business, as well as identifying areas of
                    optimisation and efficiency (hotjar, 2021).</p>
                <p>Qualitative data would be collected through the use of on and off-site surveys, lab usability testing,
                    and session recordings. Utilising qualitative data allows the business to understand what are the
                    products that generate interest, how can certain products can be recommended, what are the blockers that
                    prevent a customer from completing a purchase, and what persuades customers to complete their purchase
                    (hotjar, 2021).</p>
                <p>The customer behaviour and customer journey approach will look at identifying with customers, how they
                    think, act, and accomplish their goal. By utilising customer journeys, <em>Namshi.com</em> will be able
                    to truly personalise the customer experience from a technical and user perspective. Analysing the
                    customer journey map will give valuable insights into where expectations are not being met, whereby the
                    solution is to track back and identify what could have caused this to happen. Furthermore, it allows the
                    business to identify where the customer interacts with the business and seeks to find any unnecessary
                    interactions, such as having to continuously visit the website to see if the product or deal they would
                    like is available. Subsequently, identifying the weak points during the journey will be crucial to
                    ensuring the customer experience is continuously positive and aligns to the Peak-End Rule UX law. In
                    conjunction to the weak points, points of high interaction and high traffic can be identified to ensure
                    efficiency and great customer service (Salazar, 2020).</p>
                <p><em>Namshi.com</em> can address the challenges of team and website design through the use of UX analytics
                    coupled with the analytical capabilities in the proposed team. This will allow the organisation to
                    remain competitive, provide excellent customer service and in turn customer satisfaction, increase
                    sales, and gain the competitive advantage. The analytical capabilities should utilise data science and
                    advanced analytics methodologies to personalise content for customers through targeted and personalised
                    marketing, recommender system implementation, and great UX.</p>
    
                <h2>5. Recommendations and Conclusions</h2>
                <h3>5.1. Recommendations</h3>
                <p>Although <em>Namshi.com</em> is the leading fashion e-commerce firm in the Middle East, the organisation
                    could implement the proposed analytics and analytical capabilities to ensure that sales are increased
                    and that the business remains competitive and a market leader. Although <em>Namshi.com</em> does have
                    the largest market share in the Middle East, it could be recommended that implementing analytical
                    capabilities such as predictive and prescriptive modelling, the organisation will be able to predict
                    potential outcomes for the foreseeable future.</p>
                <p>This further suggests that <em>Namshi.com</em> could invest more in their analytical capabilities as it
                    will allow the company to become more competitive against bigger e-commerce firms. By investing into
                    these analytical capabilities such as web analytics, social media analytics, and UX analytics will allow
                    the company to truly personalise the experience for the customers, increasing customer loyalty and
