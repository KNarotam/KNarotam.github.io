                    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Initially created and formulated by Avery Smith, creator of Data Career Jumpstart (DCJ), this NFT
                        Hackathon is the second hackathon done by DCJ and is focused around NFTs. Before diving into the
                        hackathon itself, a basic understanding is required.</p>

                    <h3>1.1. What is an NFT?</h3>
                    <p>An NFT, or Non-Fungible Token, is a cryptographic asset based on blockchain technology. The
                        premise of an
                        NFT is that it cannot be replaced due to unique properties, hence non-fungible. Fungibility is
                        defined
                        as a property of goods whose units are interchangeable, i.e. if one unit of the good always
                        carries the
                        exact same value as all other units of the good. Fungibility is typically a desired property for
                        many
                        goods, but is an essential property for money. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are fungible
                        by the
                        definition, therefore an NFT being non-fungible means it cannot be replaced nor interchanged due
                        to its
                        unique properties.</p>

                    <p>Although in the more recent months, at the time of writing this, the craze around NFTs have
                        decreased
                        significantly, with notable NFTs bought by various celebrities no longer holding the value they
                        once
                        did. Nevertheless, the technology that it is built on as well as the concept of fungible and
                        non-fungible tokens and currencies is something that will be seen more in the future as web 3.0
                        advances
                        as does technology.</p>

                    <h2>2. Use Case & Data</h2>
                    <p>The chosen use case for this hackathon is around analytics. How can I extract insights from the
                        data
                        through various methods? The chosen data used in this hackathon is the Veefriends dataset. This
                        dataset
                        is Gary Vaynerchuk project on his NFT collection on OpenSea. The data details various attributes
                        of the
                        NFT, its rarity, and transaction details. OpenSea is the world's first and largest digital
                        marketplace
                        for crypto collectables and NFTs.</p>

                    <h2>3. Tools & Skills</h2>
                    <h3>3.1. Tools</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Python</li>
                        <li>Jupyter Notebook</li>
                        <li>Power BI</li>
                        <li>DAX</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>3.2. Skills</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Data Analysis</li>
                        <li>Data Visualisation</li>
                        <li>Programming</li>
                        <li>Trend Analysis</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>4. Method</h2>
                    <p>The idea behind approaching this hackathon and use case was to use Python for everything relating
                        to
                        understanding the data, cleaning it, analysing it, etc. Power BI was going to be used solely for
                        visualisation purposes with minor measures being calculated for the visuals.</p>

                    <h3>4.1. Python Notebook</h3>
                    <p>Python was used mainly to clean the data, do a brief analysis, and write the processed data to
                        files so
                        that it can be ingested into Power BI. The flow diagram below give a high-level view of what was
                        done in
                        Python. Alternatively you can take a look at the Python Notebook over <a target="_blank"
                            href="https://github.com/KNarotam/NFTHackathon/blob/main/Notebook/NFT_Hackathon.ipynb">here</a>.
                    </p>

                    <h3>4.2. Power BI</h3>
                    <p>First thing I generally do in any Power BI implementation is try to normalise data and create
                        dedicated
                        tables such as date tables, ranking tables, etc. That being said, first created table is a Date
                        table:
                    </p>
                    <p class="w3-center" style="font-family:'Courier New'">Date = CALENDAR(FIRSTDATE(AXS[Date]),
                        LASTDATE(AXS[Date]))</p>

                    <p>And further adding a column for the year, month and day. Another table created is the Ranking
                        table. The
                        ranking table was created manually ranking the rarities of the NFTs from 1 to 5, going in order
                        of
                        <i>Unknown, Rare, Very Rare, Epic, Spectacular</i> respectively. Another table entered and
                        created table
                        is the Editions table. Similar to the ranking table of rarity, the Editions table ranks the
                        edition
                        attribute from 1 to 6 ranging in increasing edition rarity.</p>

                    <p>For each crypto there are four measures created, the reason for this is to create a dynamic
                        measure and
                        value that will calculate the average low, high, volume, and price of the crypto. This is then
                        used in a
                        CASE SWITCH statement in a created Measures table.</p>

                    <p class="w3-center" style="font-family:'Courier New'">Average Crypto Price = <br>
                        SWITCH( <br>
                        SELECTEDVALUE('Measures Table'[Measure]), <br>
                        "AXS",[Avg_AXS_Price], <br>
                        "BTC", [Avg_BTC_Price],<br>
                        "ETH", [Avg_ETH_Price],<br>
                        "LINK",[Avg_LINK_Price],<br>
                        "MKR",[Avg_MKR_Price],<br>
                        "UNI", [Avg_UNI_Price])</p>

                    <h2>5. Final Dashboard</h2>

                    <p>The final dashboard is a two-pager. An introductory/summary page and something that allows for
                        the
                        analysis and a bit deeper. The first page of the dashboard breaks down the key facts and
                        figures.
                        Essentially you a timeline of sales price in Ethereum of NFTs with the distribution of the
                        rarities of
                        all the NFTs and also presents the all NFTs that sold for 3 highest values. On the right hand
                        side,
                        summarised figures detailing total sales in dollars and Ethereum; total number of sales, total
                        number of
                        transfers, and something I calculated which is the total number of NFTs minted.</p>
                    <p>The second page of the dashboard gives the user more depth and control. Two static filters exist
                        on the
                        top, one to give a date range, and the other to select multiple NFTs or search for it. A single
                        dynamic
                        filter allows the user to select either the AXS, BTC, ETH, LINK, MKR, or UNI cryptos to be able
                        to
                        update the respective average volume, average high and low price values as well as the graphs
                        comparing
                        the average price of the crypto in the day against the average sale price of the NFTs on that
                        day as
                        well as the number of transactions of NFTs in the day against the average volume of crypto
                        traded. The
                        reason those 6 cryptos are chosen is discussed in the analysis below. Another distribution graph
                        shows
                        how NFTs are distributed by their category attribute and lastly a detailed table for the user to
                        view
                        the date, NFT sold or transferred and the unique transaction hash among other details. The
                        screenshots
                        below show what the dashboard looks like or alternatively you can download it and play with it
                        from <a href="https://github.com/KNarotam/NFTHackathon/tree/main/Dashboard"

                    <h2>6. Analysis</h2>
                    <p>The six random cryptos: Axie Infinity (AXS), Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Chainlink (LINK),
                        MakerDao
                        (MKR), and Uniswap (UNI). Other than BTC, the rest are all cryptos based on Ethereum <a
                            href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/2021/02/08/which-crypto-projects-are-based-on-ethereum/"
                            target="_blank"><sup>1</sup></a>. The reason that coins based on ETH is used is because
                        OpenSea is
                        built on ETH blockchain and sales are in ETH. The idea of introducing other cryptos based on ETH
                        as well
                        as BTC is to see if there is a correlation between the price of a crypto and the price of an NFT
                        sold.
                        This was the theory. As the price of crypto increased so would the sale price of the NFT. A
                        positive
                        correlation would be predicted. This was theorised as one would or should see higher average
                        sale price
                        as one
                        would want to maximise profits. The second theory is that the volume of cryptos traded correlate
                        with
                        the number of NFT transactions.
                    </p>

                    <p>The initial theory proved correct. Across all cryptos, as the average price of the
                        cryptos
                        increase, the sale price of NFTs dropped. It had an similar relationship with one another, and
                        this is
                        further seen across most of the cryptos. LINK, MKR, and UNI seem to have a slight inverse
                        relationship
                        to the sale price of the NFTs. The second theory of more
                        transactions when the volumes of crypto is higher. We see a very close relationship across the
                        board
                        with the crypto volumes traded and the number of transactions. A further relationship can be
                        seen when
                        comparing the price of crypto and sale price of the NFT and the volumes of cryptos traded and
                        the number
                        of transactions of NFTs. This relationship is inverse, seeing as the prices go up the number of
                        transactions decrease.</p>

                    <p>Essentially the analysis shows that Ethereum based cryptos and NFTs traded on OpenSea share very
                        similar
                        trends. As crypto prices increase, the average price of on NFT sale increases in tandem, however
                        the
                        lower the volume of trades. This could align to the time and period of these transactions.
                        Judging by
                        the time period and what was making the news in the world of cryptos, NFTs were beginning to
                        look like
                        investments which aligns to the third relationship seen. Investors would look to buy low (high
                        number of
                        trades) and sell high (low number of trades). But because of many thinking NFTs were investments
                        and
                        virtual properties in the Metaverse were being sold and discussed, many saw a chance to own an
                        NFT and
                        looked to hold onto it similar to a trader holding onto a share.</p>
