                It’s that time of year again people … new games are being released and our wallets are about to take a
                beating of their lives. But I know for a fact that in the upcoming months, that it will be worth every
                penny.
                Wassup my people, your friendly insane JoKishler coming at you with his latest review about the friendly
                neighborhood Spider-Man. Yes, the <b><i>Sony PlayStation 4 Exclusive game Marvel’s Spider-Man</i></b>
                game is here and
                comparing it to the E3 press conference reveal … Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, apache
                helicopters we have a game better than the reveal. Now without further ado, get your cameras out, snap a
                pic of that menace Spider-Man and let’s get cracking with the review! (By the way, all images are taken
                by me in game.)
            </p>
            <img src="../../../Images/Gaming//Spider-Man/Spider-Man 1.jpg" style="width:100%;" alt="New York">


            <h2 class="w3-center"><b>Webbing through New York</b></h2>
            <p>Set in the city that never sleeps, Spider-Man has a large sandbox to explore and swing around through.
                Now let me just set the record straight, Insomniac Games have absolutely nailed the style, emphasis and
                fun of swinging through the city of New York. With intricate details in the swinging, like only being
                able to swing if there is something to attach your web to, Spider-Man’s web swinging is probably the
                greatest way to travel in any game period. The details like dodging fire escapes, or squeezing through
                them, and swinging low between all the cars … you really do feel like Spider-Man.
                Now unlike previous Spider-Man games, there is no origin story here, no movie franchise storyline they
                are following … this is a unique Spider-Man game set in New York. With a bustling city and enough to
                explore and do, <i>Insomniac Games</i> have truly brought to life the definition of New York, the city
                that
                never sleeps. You can even walk around town and greet people, take selfies with them and not be that
                awkward emo Spider-Man from Spider-Man 3.<br>
                I have to say though, while swinging through New York, running up buildings and being a complete utter
                badass, there are some fine intricate details set in New York every Marvel fan will truly appreciate.
                While swinging around I came across the amazing Avenger’s Tower, the Sanctum Sanctorum, Fogwell’s Gym,
                Alias Investigations, Rand Industries, Josie’s Bar and many more EPIC Marvel icons. So if swinging
                around checking out the sites, stopping a car chase or drug deal or just being a friendly neighborhood
                Spidey isn’t enough to make this open-world sandbox one of the liveliest ones, then very few worlds will
                accomplish such a thing.
            </p>
            <div class="columnPic"><img src="../../../Images/Gaming//Spider-Man/Spider-Man 2.jpg" style="width:100%;"

            <div class="columnPic"><img src="../../../Images/Gaming//Spider-Man/Spider-Man 3.jpg" style="width:100%;"

            <p>Hey everyone, your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man over here. I hope JoKishler is giving me some good
                reviews. But I thought I’d swing by the web (get the pun) in the Iron Spider suit, went around New York
                and thought I would get some visiting done and introduce you to some of my friends, but sadly no one
                answered the door. Like over here Tony Stark set up a Facebook thing for the Avengers and here is my
                profile pic (yes I am freefalling). Next up, I thought I would say heya to the Immortal Iron Fist, Danny
                Rand, buuut he’s off in Asia somewhere. </p>
            <div class="columnPic"><img src="../../../Images/Gaming//Spider-Man/Spider-Man 4.jpg" style="width:100%;"
                    alt="Freefalling"></div>
            <div class="columnPic"><img src="../../../Images/Gaming//Spider-Man/Spider-Man 5.jpg" style="width:100%;"
                    alt="Rand Industries"></div>

            <p>I thought I’d go play with the Black Panther, King T’Challa, but someone in the Wakanda Embassy said he
                was listening to “Another One Bites The Dust” (Yes I know I have a dark sense of humor get over it).
                Then I thought maybe the wizard is home, so I swung by and took this epic selfie.</p>
            <div class="columnPic"><img src="../../../Images/Gaming//Spider-Man/Spider-Man 6.jpg" style="width:100%;"
                    alt="Wakanda Embassy"></div>
            <div class="columnPic"><img src="../../../Images/Gaming//Spider-Man/Spider-Man 7.jpg" style="width:100%;"
                    alt="Sanctum Sanctorum"></div>
            <p>But the wizard wasn’t there. I think he went to the market, because Wong said he was gone to bargain (I
                don’t know what he needs to buy, he’s a wizard, can’t he just conjure something up). But since he wasn’t
                there, I had an idea for comic. “Meanwhile, in New York City, the Iron Spider lurks, ready to defend,
                while the wizard is shopping, and the Avengers are …. Uhm doing something else, New York must be
                defended by the Spider Iron. No, hold on, Iron Spider!”</p>

            <img src="../../../Images/Gaming//Spider-Man/Spider-Man 8.jpg" style="width:100%;" alt="Comic Page">
            <p>But that’s all I can say for now, I think I heard someone getting mugged. Back to you JoKishler!</p>

            <h2 class="w3-center"><b>Webheads Galore</b></h2>
            <p>RPG … yes yes and yes Spider-Man is a unique role-playing game, with a level up system (that does not
                affect the enemies sadly) BUT allows Spidey to unlock new suits, abilities and gadgets as the story
                progresses. From the original Spider-Man Classic suit, to the Advanced suit (designed by Otto Octavious)
                that graces the cover, to Spider-Noir, to the Iron Spider from Avengers 4 … you can choose what suit you
                want to wear each having their own special suit abilities and looks.
                <br>
                This means that we can choose what you want to wear, what abilities you have to play with and even mess
                around with your fighting
                style. In saying that, the combat system I found is similar to that of the Batman Arkham series, with
                dodge counters appearing, the choice of attacking silently or all guns blazing and truth be told … it’s
                kind of fun going guns blazing. Interacting with your environment, webbing down one thug and swinging
                him around and around and around and around and …. I’m getting dizzy hold up … You guys get my point.
                The fighting is spectacular and engaging, the enemies are tricky at times especially when 6 thugs
                surround you, while one sits back with a rocket launcher and a brute charges you down … oh yeah and also
                you’re low on health and kind of sort of short on web fluid … uhm can someone press pause please … it
                seems like $h!t is about to go down and I think I here Aunt May calling me. “Coming Aunt May!!!”</p>
            <img src="../../../Images/Gaming//Spider-Man/Spider-Man 9.jpg" style="width:100%;" alt="Suits">

            <h2 class="w3-center"><b>Webs Up or Down</b></h2>
            <p>Now no game would be complete without any criticism, and for me I hate to admit it, but I have a few
                problems with Spider-Man. First of all, Peter Parker, look I get it, he’s been Spidey for 8 years now
                and yes he looks as if James Franco and Tom Holland had a child. I don’t know about you, but personally
                I’m not a huge fan of how Peter Parker looks. Secondly, and for me this is a big problem with games of
                today … If I have done 3 story missions, basically explored the city unlocking all viewpoints and done
                some side activities and my completion is already sitting at 25% … we have a problem or so I thought.
                Now I don’t mind replaying games, hell I’ve played GTA V four times … come to think of it, I think it’s
                time I play it for a fifth time. But back to Spider-Man, it worried me that not truly progressing
                through many story missions has completed about a quarter of the game. Although the progression seems
                quick, the game has plenty of things to do that will keep you busy for hours and hours. And everything
                ties in with the storyline perfectly. So far I am loving every second of it and cannot wait to play some
                more. So all credit to you <i>Insomniac Games</i>, you guys did a bang up of a job, and I’ll be waiting
                for the
                sequel.</p>
            <p>Truth be told Marvel’s Spider-Man is an absolute brilliant game with a sandbox environment bursting to be
                explored, NPC’s eager to mess around with and RPG elements that keep the player intrigued, busy and
                addicted to the game, with new challenges and activities to beat and unlock. Now I know some people out
                there (Kavi and Iordan) say that I have yet to give a bad review … well maybe did you guys think I just
                don’t play crappy games? What? What? What? Yeah that’s right son I just said that! But guys, if you have
                a PlayStation 4 I urge you to get your hands on this game, I mean perks of it will be to rub it in to
                everyone who doesn’t have a PS4 (PlayStation Master Race!) oh and you know, the fact that it is the best
                Spider-Man game ever made. </p>
