                            asked
                            questions that were relevant to the processes being audited.
                            He worked very well with no supervision from the Internal Audit Team.
                            His turnaround time was always very quick, which was also notable by Senior Clover
                            Management.
                            He produced exceptional high-quality work, with additional value add which was also notable
                            to the client.

                            that was
                            achieved overall on the entire account.
                            He prepared adequately for the meetings (opening, status updates, clarification and close
                            out meetings),
                            which he was able to chair and in certain cases answer
                            difficult technical questions from Finance/IT specialist.
                            Client queries and additional requests were addressed timeously by Kishan and always made
                            himself
                            available.
                            Internal Team status updates were provided by him before even being requested from him.

                            He managed to build very strong relationships with Clover Senior Management, within a very
                            short space of
                            time.
                            He reported on his deliverable's way before the set deadlines.
