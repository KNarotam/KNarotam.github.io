                Hey Arkane Studios, give me one order of Dishonored, with a side of 1960s, a dash of timelooping, and an
                intriguing premise. That’s exactly what we got with Arkane’s latest development Deathloop. That’s right
                people, after a while JoKishler is back with a review for Deathloop. “If at first you don’t succeed,
                die, die again.”
            </p>

            <h2 class="w3-center"><b>Death-Defying Story</b></h2>
            <p>Set in the 1960s, on Blackreef island, you take on the role of Colt Vahn, a bad ass motherfucker with no
                memory of what happened, why is someone is hunting him, why the same day keeps repeating, or what the
                hell are his particular set of skills. The story follows Colt and his countless attempts to break the
                loop of this day. While uncovering the reasons for his wacky version of Groundhog Day (if you don’t know
                this, Google it, and if you had to Google it … well I’m disowning you), but back to the game. Colt
                uncovers the secrets behind the program that put them there, who are the main people in charge of this
                program, and how can he put a stop to it.</p>

            <p>Blackreef is a beautifully weird island, with 4 locations that can be explored as you see fit. Playable
                at 4 distinct times of day, each area on Blackreef is filled with information, secrets, enemies and an
                ever-changing environment. And last but not least, the 7 visionaries that need to be hunted, while at
                the same time being hunted yourself. Deathloop’s environment, ways of executing your targets leave the
                player with multiple ways to explore, with twists and turns and each loop over, this game is going to
                keep you coming back!</p>

            <h2 class="w3-center"><b>Death From All Angles</b></h2>
            <p>Combined with a beautiful environment and attention detail, Deathloop’s combat is simple, effective and
                tonnes of fun. With a style and power similar to that of Dishonored, the way you play and kill is all up
                to you. If you want to go gang-ho on the enemies, that stock up your guns, choose your charms, get your
                powers ready and go nuts. Or if you’re like me play stealth, and sneak behind and whack them assassin
                style. Either way, Deathloop leaves the option up to you.</p>

            <p>The weapons are limited, but as the rarity increases, so do some of their abilities like causing
                bleeding, or slowing health-regen and blah blah blah. And from the power point … well this was a bit of
                an annoyance for me. You have a choice of 7 slabs that each grant you some pretty epic abilities. But
                anytime you go out to explore, you’re only choosing 2. Now I found myself using the Shift and Nexus
                slabs a lot. Shift, obviously like Dishonored, gets you to places. Nexus, well what happens to one
                enemy, affects others if they’re linked. With telekinesis style power, invisibility, and the ability to
                rewind a little time after you die being available each time you go out, Colt’s ability to be a badass
                is limited by your playstyle.</p>

            <h2 class="w3-center"><b>Death-looping Back</b></h2>
            <p>Now as time went on, and the story began to unfold, I found myself being able to assassinate and plan all
                7 visionaries in a single loop become progressively easier and fun, with the trick being how to group
                some together and giving them the old whack! I won’t lie about midway through, I found myself killing
                visionaries over and over, to a point where some that were alone, I ended up knowing how to do it
                blindfolded. But counterpoint, I started finding more fun ways to kill them, using their own turrets
                against them, or a trip mine, or even grabbing my sword and just straight up running at them and gutting
                them. Each time I had more fun, and each time it got easier. And once the plan comes together, that
                final run of the loop is incredibly fun, knowing where they are, how to kill them, and actually
                executing them reached a great peak. HOWEVER … I found the ending a tad bit … well plain. With 3
                possible endings, the “good” ending that I got was a bit anti-climactic. The others leave more to hope
                for, and actually potential for a sequel.</p>

            <h2 class="w3-center"><b>Death to the Loop</b></h2>
            <p>Arkane’s latest development and exploration into a timeloop game is probably one of the best implemented.
                With a great story line, excellent environment, twist and turns, and the ability to play to your style,
                leaves the game highly recommendable and tonnes of fun. The combat is simple, but gives you the chance
                to try multiple variations and styles, and you can play to your style, limited by your creativity … and
                well the bounds of the game. If you liked Dishonored’s style, then you will definitely love Deathloop,
                especially in a 60s environment.</p>
