            <hr style="width:page" class="w3-opacity">
            <p>The coronavirus pandemic has been affecting the industries around the world, with the travel and
                hospitality being negatively impacted the most. But one industry that has seen a bit of mixed emotions
                has been the fashion industry.</p>

            <p>The pandemic is ongoing and with majority of the world working from home and remotely, daily office wear
                went from suits and ties to sweatpants and tees. Now I don&rsquo;t know about you, but for me I kind of
                hated it at first. I enjoyed dressing up for work, choosing a lapel pin to match with the shirt, and a
                bracelet for the day. Now, working from home, I barely put on a watch, let alone some sort of formal
                attire. But that is just me, let's dive into how this frustrating pandemic has affected the
                industry.</p>

            <p>According to McKinsey, they forecast that the global luxury goods market will contract by 35%-39% this
                year, as shoppers have slowed their spending. The idea of luxury has moved from the aesthetics of
                fashion and cars to health and vitality. Surveys were done in the US and in Shanghai on luxury buyers.
                Now for those of you who don't know what luxury buyer is, simply put, it is a person who spends
                $2,000 on a single fashion item in the past 12 months. Now as a result of this survey, it was found that
                luxury buyers were boasting about their newly purchased high-end fitness equipment instead, and that
                this was now becoming a status symbol <sup><a href="1">1</a></sup>.</p>

            <p>But as stores began to open worldwide, people were not flocking to the brick-and-mortar outlets because
                things have changed. We are now accustomed to entering a store, having your temperature checked and
                hands sanitized, but that does not really mix with the idea of luxury shopping now does it? Let's
                do the math:<br>
                <i>Luxury boutique store + having your temperature checked + wearing a mask &#8800; a luxury
                    experience </i><sup><a href="1">1</a></sup>.</p>

            <p>All of those luxury fashion items, which are set to rebound after the pandemic, known as "quiet
                luxury";, is already seeing a resurgence, specifically the high-end brands such as Hermes, Prada
                and Bottega Veneta. After the '08-'09 economic crisis, luxury brands were able to charge
                significantly more for certain items. For example, the Hermes Kelly bag retailed for upwards of $4,800
                in
                2000, but 13 years later, that same bag was priced at $7,600. Basically, what I am trying to say, is
                that
                if you want some of that luxury, now is a time to buy it, because the expectation is to see a positive
                growth of 1%-4% in the next year alone <sup><a href="1">1</a></sup></p>

            <p>Although the future growth seems to be positive, the current impact that COVID has had on the fashion
                industry is truly seen in the factories in Bangladesh. Bangladesh is the world&rsquo;s second-largest
                apparel exporter of western fast fashion brands. I will get into what fast fashion is later on, but what
                this pandemic has meant for this industry, according to Bloomberg, is a shutdown of approximately 1089
                garment factories and a loss of approximately $1.5 billion. Now the reason that loss is so substantial
                is because of the way payments to these factories are done. Brands generally would pay the factories
                weeks or months after delivery has been made, the factories however pay upfront for the materials used.
                Brands have ended up cancelling orders when the pandemic hit, even stopping payments, and the factories
                have had to end up destroying these garments or holding on to them <sup><a href="2">2</a></sup> <sup><a
                        href="3">3</a></sup>.</p>

            <p>Did you know that the fashion industry accounts for 10% of the world&rsquo;s carbon emissions, as well as
                drying up water sources and polluting rivers and streams <sup><a href="2">2</a></sup> <sup><a
                    href="3">3</a></sup>? This means that the industry severely needs
                a sustainable material that must be added to the supply chain. In Indonesia, experts have seen the
                demand for Tencel fibers, which are cellulosic fibres derived from renewable wood sources. This is an
                absolute gamechanger for the industry, as it offers long-lasting comfort to soft-feel fabrics; it is
                biodegradable; and will last longer as the fibres are stronger. And if this sounds too good to be true,
                well it is not, the pricing is not either. Tencel fibres can blended with other fibres to bring down
                prices and fit well within the supply chain <sup><a href="4">4</a></sup>.</p>

            <p>When the pandemic began in March/April, fashion brands panicked, and tried to clean out their inventory,
                offering discounts of up to 70%. But as stores began to close, and lockdown was being extended,
                e-commerce stores saw an increase in sales, specifically the fast fashion brands. H&M online sales
                increased by 36% between March and May; the ASOS Group&rsquo;s international sales were up by 17%;
                Zalando, Europe's largest e-tailor estimates a record &euro;300 million earnings <sup><a
                        href="5">5</a></sup>.</p>

            <p>Now what exactly is fast fashion. Fast fashion is clothing designs, typically similar to high-end brands,
                that move quickly from the catwalk to stores. For example, Zara would take Balenciaga high-top sock
                sneakers and create something similar, and retail it for a tenth of the cost. Now, what the industry saw
                during lockdown was that the focus on fashion was on casual and loungewear, which makes sense. But
                fashion insiders do not think this will last long, as fashion is like a pendulum, swinging from one
                extreme to the other. In 1918, the Spanish Flu ravaged the world, and like now, casual and comfortable
                fashion was sought after. However, when the pandemic ended in 1920, it welcomed in the era of the
                roaring 20s. Now I can tell you, I am extremely keen to hit up a few roaring 20s looks this decade
                <sup><a href="6">6</a></sup>.
            </p>

            <p> Although the fashion industry took a hit, it does not mean they have not taken advantage of it. Numerous
                accessories have been created, such as custom masks, designed mask cases, gloves, push-stick keychains
                and even wearable air purifier necklaces. Ultimately, I believe that wearing masks and similar
                precautions are going to be in place for years to come, and as everything, we must adapt and evolve to
                it. From matching belts and shoes, to matching masks and gloves, one can hope the pendulum swings to the
                other end in no time.</p>
