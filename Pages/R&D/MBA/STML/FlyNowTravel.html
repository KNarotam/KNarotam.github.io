            <hr style="width:page" class="w3-opacity">

            <h1 class="w3-center">1. Introduction</h1>
            <p>FlyNow Travel is a small family-owned travel agency with approximately 20 employees based in
                Johannesburg, South Africa. Initially operating under a different name, Flywell Travel; FlyNow Travel
                was built out of a split partnership with Flywell Travel and over 40 years has constantly been
                recognised as a respectable travel agency in both corporate and leisure travel. As a member of the XL
                Travel Group, FlyNow Travel forms part of the diverse, owner-managed agencies, as they strive to bring
                their expert knowledge and experience to their customers providing them with a doorway to their
                destination.</p>

            <p>Over the last year, the COVID-19 pandemic has ravaged the world, its people and all businesses from small
                to global enterprises. Many businesses were forced to close doors, and the BEACH (Booking, Entertainment
                &amp; Liver Events, Airlines, Cruises &amp; Casinos, Hotels &amp; Resorts) industry was one of those
                affected the most. In March 2020, the BEACH stocks lost $332 billion in value (Neufeld, 2020). Before
                the pandemic, the travel and tourism industry warranted 10% of the global economy and with the various
                global travel restrictions and regulations, as well as the unlikelihood of vaccine passports or some
                alternative, being implemented anytime soon (Cherney, 2021); small businesses like FlyNow Travel need to
                implement a new strategy to ensure the business does not shut down and can sustainably continue to
                provide their services to their customers.</p>

            <h1 class="w3-center">2. Stakeholder Analysis</h1>
            <p>R. Edward Freeman defines that one of the purposes of strategic management is to give an organisation a
                direction and help reach it. Stakeholders &ndash; being those who can have an impact, both significant
                and minor, in the implementation and direction of the plan &ndash; must be considered in the strategic
                management process (Freeman, 1984). In assisting FlyNow with their new strategic management approach,
                the first step would be to analyse their stakeholders and perform a stakeholder analysis.</p>
            <h2 class="w3-center">2.1. Identifying Stakeholders</h2>
            <p>Identifying the various stakeholders that affect FlyNow are broken down into: <em>Internal</em> and
                <em>External</em> stakeholders. The Internal stakeholders are those that have the direct relationship
                with the business, and all of the other stakeholders will be considered External (Fernando, 2021). Many
                of the identified stakeholders listed below are also those found in the tourism industry themselves,
                however given that FlyNow is a small business, it&rsquo;s effect and impact on the stakeholders is not
                as significant as the impact of some of the stakeholders on FlyNow (Stainton, 2020).</p>
            <h3 class="w3-center">2.1.1. Internal Stakeholders</h3>
            <p>Three internal stakeholders have been identified for FlyNow Travel:</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left:26px;">
                <li>Employees</li>
                <li>Tourists/Clients</li>
                <li>XL Travel Group.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The 17 <strong>employees</strong> within FlyNow are not only the backbone of the company, but will also
                dictate how well the company performs financially and how well they maintain and improve their
                reputation and brand. The <strong>tourists/clients</strong> are the lifeline of the business, as their
                loyalty, and willingness to use the travel agency over competitors is what has kept this business alive
                for 40 years and will continue to keep the business running and growing. Unlike other travel groups, the
                <strong>XL Travel Group</strong> offers their travel agencies an opportunity to be run in their own way
                by only paying a membership fee. The risk for the XL Travel Group is that should FlyNow Travel not be a
                reputable brand anymore, it could harm the broader group&rsquo;s standing and reputation.</p>
            <h3 class="w3-center">2.1.2. External Stakeholders</h3>
            <p>The external stakeholders identified are:</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left:26px;">
                <li>Local airlines</li>
                <li>International airlines</li>
                <li>Government (local and foreign)</li>
                <li>Utility organisations</li>
                <li>Car rental agencies</li>
                <li>Hotels</li>
                <li>Tour operators</li>
                <li>Transport/Taxi organisations</li>
                <li>Banks</li>
                <li>Educators/Training Facilitators</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The <strong>airline</strong> industry is the backbone of the tourism industry both on a
                <strong>local</strong> and <strong>international</strong> level, as the main reason a customer uses a
                travel agent. The <strong>government</strong> are those who control the travel restrictions between all
                countries especially given the problem and the world&rsquo;s current COVID-19 pandemic. <strong>Utility
                    organisations</strong> are those that provide the travel agency, the airports and the country the
                necessary infrastructure and necessities in running the business and supports the industry. Given South
                Africa&rsquo;s electricity crisis, this stakeholder has an impact on the business and its success.
                <strong>Car rental agencies,</strong> <strong>hotels, tour operators and transport/taxi
                    organisations</strong> rely on the likes of travel agents and booking sites to help boost their own
                economy and organisation (Stainton, 2020). <strong>Banks</strong> are the external stakeholders affected
                by both the customers, the business and all other stakeholders as they provide the finances for all
                stakeholders. The <strong>education/training facilitators</strong> are the last identified stakeholders
                as upskilling any new or current employees will be halted as the organisation has very little to no
                business.</p>

            <h2 class="w3-center">2.2. Stakeholder Map</h2>

            <img src="Figure1.png" style="width:100%;" alt="Figure 1">
            <figcaption class="w3-center">Fig.1 - Stakeholder Map (Mind Tools Content Team, n.d.)</figcaption>

            <p>Figure 1 is the stakeholder map originally adapted from Mendelow&rsquo;s Power Dynamism Matrix for
                Environment Scanning (Mind Tools Content Team, n.d.). By using this stakeholder map, management at
                FlyNow Travel can now identify which stakeholders should be prioritised and engaged with more
                frequently. The impact of the stakeholder on FlyNow Travel and the impact of FlyNow Travel on the
                stakeholder have also been identified to allow management to understand how to engage with these
                stakeholders.</p>

            <h2 class="w3-center">2.3. Stakeholder Engagement</h2>
            <p>To ensure the success of FlyNow&rsquo;s strategy moving forward, proper stakeholder engagement must be
                observed. Based on the stakeholder map in Figure 1, those who have an impact on the strategy must have
                their regulations and requirements met. Such as the governments with their regulations and restrictions,
                as well as airlines whom are instructed when and where they can fly during COVID retractions. In South
                Africa, the power utility Eskom, struggles to provide power constantly and the business may be subject
                to predetermined power cuts and this must be monitored to ensure the business can continue to provide
                value to their customers. The employees of FlyNow must be constantly engaged with management to discuss
                new strategies and ways of working moving forward. They ensure the success of the business going
                forward.</p>

            <p>The stakeholders impacted by FlyNow form part of a broader discussion and will be impacted by how well
                FlyNow address the ongoing pandemic and the new strategy. They must be kept in constant discussion and
                potentially be brought in as informants. For example, hotels and tour operators would have seen a
                decline in business given the lack of tourists and as a result must be informed of any new strategies,
                be it partnerships, market penetration or development with FlyNow. This will allow the
                stakeholder&rsquo;s respective strategies to align with an external strategy that could assist in
                boosting the tourism industry.</p>

            <h1 class="w3-center">3. External Factors (PESTLE Analysis)</h1>
            <p>Before deciding on a new strategy going forward, FlyNow Travel need to identify the impact of the various
                external factors on the business. A PESTLE analysis, seen in Figure 2, is carried out to fully
                understand and address various factors such as:</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left:26px;">
                <li>Political</li>
                <li>Economic</li>
                <li>Sociocultural</li>
                <li>Technological</li>
                <li>Legal</li>
                <li>Environmental (Morrison, 2013).</li>
            </ul>

            <img src="Figure2.png" style="width:100%;" alt="Figure 2">
            <figcaption class="w3-center">Fig.2 - PESTLE Analysis (Morrison, 2013)</figcaption>

            <h2 class="w3-center">3.1. Political</h2>
            <p>The various political aspects that could affect FlyNow Travel stem from the responses that governments
                from various countries have given with regards to the COVID-19 pandemic. Now that the virus has multiple
                strains and a second and third wave looming, flights to and from various countries are being banned.
                Given the large population of Indians in South Africa, direct flights from India and South Africa were
                cancelled, and so travelling to India had to be done via a second country, such as UAE or Qatar. But due
                to the increasing number of infections in India, many countries have banned tourists from travelling to
                India or coming from India. These countries include the UAE, Australia, Canada, Saudi Arabia, UK, USA
                and China (CNN Staff, 2021).</p>

            <h2 class="w3-center">3.2. Economic</h2>
            <p>South Africa is still a developing country, with a heavily influenced economy, and the pandemic had
                affected an already downward economy resulting in the unemployment rate reaching a record value of 30.8%
                in the last quarter of 2020 (Bohlmann, et al., 2021). The restrictions from government, lack of
                unemployment funding has affected FlyNow and its employees as management had given all employees three
                months of salary in an attempt to help amidst the ongoing pandemic.</p>

            <h2 class="w3-center">3.3. Sociocultural</h2>
            <p>The pandemic affected all business in an unplanned manner and resulted in majority of the workforce,
                working from home. This began to increase frustrations at home and with travel restrictions in place on
                an international travel, many tourists are looking for alternatives to satisfy their vacationing
                desires. As a result, local tourism and domestic travel has seen a sharp increase within South Africa as
                lockdown restrictions have begun to ease (Domestic Flights South Africa, 2021). With the tourism
                industry at a standstill, the employees at FlyNow Travel have to be downsized to ensure that the
                business does not begin to suffer a loss and go into debt.</p>

            <h2 class="w3-center">3.4. Technological</h2>
            <p>Travel agencies like FlyNow Travel does not only have competition in physical travel agencies but are at
                a severe disadvantage to Online Travel Agents such as Booking.com, TripAdvisor, Airbnb and Trivago. The
                need for an online and digital presence is vital as this will allow a small business to reach more
                customers and a broader range of customers. With the use of the likes of Google Ads Services, FlyNow
                Travel could see a significant boost in customers and economic activity.</p>

            <h2 class="w3-center">3.5. Legal</h2>
            <p>With the pandemic ongoing and working from home still being the preferred option, FlyNow Travel must
                adhere to these regulations with their staff. These regulations and safety protocols are also adhered to
                if and when any customers visit on the premises. Given the nature of the business, the government
                regulations and restrictions must be considered when planning and creating an itinerary for any client.
                For example, any person travelling from India to Dubai, must be out of India for 14 days before being
                permitted into Dubai.</p>

            <h2 class="w3-center">3.6. Environmental</h2>
            <p>There are not many environmental aspects that must be taken into consideration when analysing the
                external factors of FlyNow Travel. Natural disasters may cause concern for travellers travelling to the
                affected places, and should this occur, the consultants at FlyNow Travel must be considerate and conform
                to any regulations presented by any governing bodies and converse this to their clients. Travelling may
                be a seasonal matter, but given travel restrictions, this is not of any concern for the near future
                given international restrictions on travel.</p>


            <h1 class="w3-center">4. Strategy Formulation</h1>
            <p>Now that part of the external environment has been analysed using the PESTLE analysis, the internal and
                the rest of the external environments must be analysed using the SWOT analysis before formulating a new
                strategy.</p>

            <h2 class="w3-center">4.1. SWOT Analysis</h2>
            <p>The <strong>strengths&nbsp;</strong>and <strong>weaknesses&nbsp;</strong>identified are internal to
                FlyNow Travel and the <strong>opportunities</strong> and <strong>threats</strong> to FlyNow Travel are
                external to FlyNow. The goal of a SWOT analysis is to take the strengths and capitalise on them;
                subsequently it is to identify weaknesses and improve on them. The opportunities identified must be
                monitored as this can lead to a new venture and have a positive influence and lastly the threats must be
                eliminated to ensure survivability and profitability of FlyNow Travel (Parsons, 2021). Figure 3 shows
                the key points of the SWOT analysis.</p>

            <h3 class="w3-center">4.1.1. Strengths</h3>
            <p>FlyNow Travel&rsquo;s management has a 40-year relationship with the Indian community in Johannesburg and
                is highly respected. The loyalty of their clientele is a definite strength of the company as was
                apparent when the original partnership with the Flywell Travel brand was dissolved. The management at
                FlyNow Travel also have trusting relationships with many managers at reputable airlines both
                international and local. The biggest strength that is displayed is that the consultants provide
                excellent service to the customers (both tourists and corporate) by resolving multiple issues and
                catering to their clients&rsquo; needs. FlyNow Travel has the distinct advantage of having their offices
                in two locations in Johannesburg, the head office based in an affluent neighbourhood near their
                corporate clientele and a smaller office in a more central location to the Indian community. Given that
                majority of the clients at the secondary office are walk-in clients who are Indian/Pakistani/Bangladeshi
                nationals, the service, expertise and recognition provided by the consultants are FlyNow Travel give
                them a competitive advantage over their competitors.</p>

            <h3 class="w3-center">4.1.2. Weaknesses</h3>
            <p>Due to the restrictions placed by international and local governments because of the ongoing pandemic,
                international leisure travel is seen to be on the decline. As a result of this FlyNow Travel has seen a
                decline in customers and cash flow while still holding onto their entire staff. As respected as they
                are, FlyNow does not have a digital footprint and relies more on walk-in clients and phone calls given
                by reference. Another weakness is that the number of corporate clienteles is small and limited as this
                forms part of the backbone of the FlyNow Travel cash flow. FlyNow travel has many relationships with
                international tour operators but due to the pandemic cannot utilise these relationships, contrary to
                this FlyNow does not have many relationships with local tour operators.</p>

            <h3 class="w3-center">4.1.3. Opportunities</h3>
            <p>With the COVID pandemic still ongoing, many travellers are looking to travelling locally and experience
                tourism in their own country. There is support from the South African government&rsquo;s Minister of
                Tourism to meeting the demand of local travellers to experience local tourism (Business Tech, 2021).
                Many competitors have closed their doors due to the pandemic with a slow recovery plan, this gives
                FlyNow the opportunity to use their brand and recognition in the community to look for local tour
                operators and partnerships to improve the business and tourism within South Africa. Another opportunity
                exists with a digital implementation including a website and potential phone app to bring an easier
                experience to the customers during lockdown.</p>

            <h3 class="w3-center">4.1.4. Threats</h3>
            <p>A major threat to FlyNow Travel is the location of their secondary office, as the area is saturated by
                travel agencies giving FlyNow Travel fierce competition. Besides physical travel agents, global
                competitors, also known as Online Travel Agents (OTA), such as Booking.com bring an easier experience to
                their users making the need for physical travel agents null.</p>

            <h3 class="w3-center">4.1.5. Summarised SWOT Analysis</h3>
            <img src="Figure3.png" style="width:100%;" alt="Figure 3">
            <figcaption class="w3-center">Fig.3 - Summarised SWOT Analysis</figcaption>

            <h2 class="w3-center">4.2. Proposed Strategy</h2>
            <p>The new strategy for FlyNow Travel would be a dual-approach strategy combining the non-price competitive
                strategy of <strong><em>Product Development</em></strong> and a horizontal integration of a
                <strong><em>Merger</em></strong> type strategy. The Product Development approach will allow FlyNow
                Travel to explore the opportunities of the digital space such as digital marketing, personalised web
                page, phone applications giving some competition to existing OTAs. The Merger approach works
                hand-in-hand with Product Development strategy as this will provide management to pursue partnerships
                with local tour operators and other tourism services; such as game and safari lodges and other notable
                tourist attractions to benefit from the current local tourism boom and allow that to be another backbone
                to the company&rsquo;s cash flow.</p>

            <p>By utilising a dual approach as suggested, FlyNow will have the opportunity to continue operating under
                the strain of the pandemic, improve the marketing and recognition of the brand through the digital space
                and continue to provide their customers with the expert knowledge and experience they have been
                accustomed to for the past 40 years.</p>

            <h2 class="w3-center">4.3. Strategy Evaluation</h2>
            <p>This would be the best way forward as the main backbone of FlyNow&rsquo;s business was their few
                corporate accounts and the large international leisure customers. By working with local tour operators
                and companies, FlyNow can now develop and create new packages for their customers to purchase and
                experience while international restrictions are still in effect. This will allow FlyNow to develop new
                marketing strategies to reach the public and in turn boost the local tourism industry. When travel
                restrictions are lifted and international travel will be allowed, the partnerships with local tour
                operators and various packages can still be leveraged for the all customers, including those travelling
                to South Africa.</p>


            <h1 class="w3-center">5. Strategy Explanation</h1>
            <p>In order for FlyNow to implement the new strategy well, prior research was done on general advice and
                knowledge on how to improve the sales performance of any travel agency. Being in an increasingly
                competitive industry, the goal of any travel agency is to ensure the customer and user experience is
                better than any other agencies and even OTAs. It can be seen that two key factors stand out in order to
                improve the sales of any travel agency. The first is a digital presence, inferring to using the likes of
                social media to improve marketing and reaching a better audience and having some sort of online
                consultation available. The second factor is partnerships or business-to-business networking. This will
                allow the likes of FlyNow Travel to leverage off these relationships for a better customer experience
                creating the idea of a &ldquo;one-stop shop&rdquo; for any and all travel requirements (Lemax, 2018)
                (Morgaine, n.d.).</p>

            <h2 class="w3-center">5.1. Supporting Innovation and Change</h2>
            <p>As per the research done on improving the sales of a travel agency, it can be seen that the dual-approach
                proposed would address both of the improvement factors mentioned above. The Merger approach will allow
                for new packages to be created in the local market that can be given to customers at competitive prices
                benefitting both partners involved. This then leads into the Product Development approach by allowing
                FlyNow to leverage not only new partnerships, but those existing with local airlines, hotels and car
                rental agencies to provide a full package and complete experience to their customers at a competitive
                cost.</p>

            <p>The introduction of these new local products not only benefit all parties, but allow the tourism industry
                within South Africa to continually grow and in a sustainable manner, as this brings a new product on
                offer for any international travellers. The addition of the local tourism will give FlyNow a new
                direction to work towards and once the pandemic is nearing its end, and the global tourism industry is
                nearing its normal state, the new products on offer for local tourism provides FlyNow with a new income
                stream building on their current offerings and service.</p>

            <p>The other part of the Product Development approach is the digital aspect of the new strategy. By
                exploring the digital space and creating the digital presence, FlyNow Travel is able to explore new
                marketing opportunities using social media. In conjunction to this, the creation of a website that can
                be done by the XL Travel Group will make the user experience more streamlined and safer during the
                pandemic. This will also allow FlyNow travel to be on a somewhat equal playing field as their
                competitors such as the Flight Centre group and even OTAs.</p>

            <h2 class="w3-center">5.2. Critical Analysis</h2>
            <p>The dual-strategy approach of the Product Development and Merger strategies will address all of the
                opportunities and threats that are present to FlyNow Travel while leveraging their current strengths and
                would hopefully address some of their weaknesses. The dual-approach chosen holds an advantage over a
                Digital Transformation Strategy as the Digital Transformation Strategy looks at adjusting the business
                to address and present itself in the digital marketplace (Briggs, 2020). If FlyNow were to implement a
                Digital Transformation Strategy, they would only be addressing a part of the threats presented by their
                competitors. It would allow them to be more innovative but would require major organisational changes
                such as people and infrastructure which would be increasingly costly.</p>

            <p>The tourism industry is a hyper-competitive environment and choosing a Cost Leadership strategic approach
                may allow FlyNow to gain a significant advantage over their competitors. The issue with using this
                approach is that the profit margins are then reduced and in order to stay in business with a positive
                cash flow, FlyNow needs majority share of the customers. Although their reputation and service exceed
                others, this approach may not be sustainable going forward. However, using elements of the
                Cost-Leadership approach in creating the packages would allow FlyNow to become more unique in their
                product offerings leading to a more Focused strategy based on the local tourism industry. Subsequently,
                when travel restrictions are eased and international tourism is being welcomed, the Focused approach
                will not be sustainable and could result in FlyNow requiring a new strategic plan.</p>

            <p>Another reason that the dual-approach should be the preferred strategic way forward is that it allows
                FlyNow to grow their business in a declining economy with the ongoing pandemic. If the company had
                chosen to use a Defender strategy, and protect their current customer base, whilst attempting to
                maintain stable growth the company would not survive the remainder of the pandemic and may be forced to
                close doors. Although their customer base may be loyal and their corporate accounts are focused mainly
                on local travel, it is not sustainable for the business during the pandemic as their leisure market
                would be at a standstill. Although the vaccine rollout is underway on a global scale, international
                restrictions are still in place and all rules must still be adhered to.</p>

            <p>FlyNow Travel could attempt to use the Diversification strategy in an attempt to continue to operate
                within the tourism industry, but move from the travel agency area to the tour operator area. This would
                give FlyNow Travel a distinct competitive advantage over their competitors, however may be a very costly
                strategy going forward. This strategy would require large organisational change and may only bring
                profitable business at a further stage than management is willing to wait for.</p>

            <h1 class="w3-center">6. Implementation Plan</h1>
            <p>In order to execute the new strategy, an implementation plan must be developed for FlyNow Travel. The
                structure of the implementation plan would be as follows:</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left:26px;">
                <li>Research and Discovery</li>
                <li>Risk assessment and Budget</li>
                <li>Roadshow</li>
                <li>Assign responsibility</li>
                <li>Develop schedule</li>
                <li>Review.</li>
</ul>
                <h2 class="w3-center">6.1. Research and Discovery</h2>
                <p>The implementation plan begins with the Research and Discovery phase which will allow management to
                    decide on the desired outcomes, how will it benefit the business and how does one define success
                    (Malsam, 2019). This will allow management to agree on the communal outcome, potential
                    organisational changes and most importantly ensuring that the new strategy will achieve the
                    business&rsquo;s objectives.</p>

                <h2 class="w3-center">6.2. Risk Assessment and Budget</h2>
                <p>The next step in the implementation plan is to perform a thorough risk and budget assessment. The
                    risks, assumptions and mitigation strategies developed here will be vital to the execution of the
                    new strategy. The risk assessment will involve in-depth research into similar strategic initiatives
                    as well as assessing the current situation and the final goal to ensure that the implementation will
                    be as smooth as possible. In addition, performing a thorough risk assessment will leave the business
                    in good standing before implementing and give rise to better decision-making as the implementation
                    goes on (Keqa &amp; Albarina, 2016).</p>

                <p>Since FlyNow Travel is a small business, budgeting for the implementation of this new strategy will
                    be crucial as it should not impact current business cash-flow including salaries paid to employees
                    and service provided to customers. Considering the risks identified it will allow management to
                    budget accordingly and adjust spending for the implementation of the strategy (Morpus, 2020).</p>

                <h2 class="w3-center">6.3. Roadshow</h2>
                <p>The idea behind adding the Roadshow phase of the implementation plan is to present the new strategy
                    and goals to all major stakeholders. In doing so, this allows management to gain valuable buy-in
                    from all major stakeholders and adjust the strategy accordingly. This includes presenting the
                    proposed strategy and implementation of it to those businesses that form part of the Merger strategy
                    proposed for FlyNow Travel.</p>

                <p>By presenting the proposed strategy and implementation to potential partners, it will allow those
                    potential partners to provide valuable feedback and adjust their strategy accordingly to accommodate
                    FlyNow&rsquo;s potential partnership. Discussions of the type of new products that can be developed
                    should be discussed in detail here and taken into account during the implementation of the strategy.
                </p>

                <h2 class="w3-center">6.4. Assign Responsibility</h2>
                <p>Assigning champions/owners for the implementation process and smaller goals will give that
                    champion/owner the responsibility of tracking the overall implementation. This includes tracking and
                    monitoring how productive the team is, assigning tasks and keeping the implementation on the correct
                    track (Morpus, 2020). Choosing the champion is an important part of the implementation plan as this
                    will also present accountability and ownership to the relevant person and team. The champions/owners
                    will also be responsible for ensuring the implementation continues to align to FlyNow&rsquo;s
                    objective and vision.</p>

                <p>Assigning responsibility does not only involve choosing the champion/owner but would also involve
                    creating and allocating the team, whether temporary or permanent, to ensure the implementation of
                    the strategy is done so seamlessly.</p>

                <h2 class="w3-center">6.5. Develop Schedule</h2>
                <p>This stage of the implementation plan is when the actual implementation would actually occur and the
                    project is physically underway. Given the nature of the organisation, its structure and the type of
                    strategic implementation that will be occurring, it would be best to choose an Agile methodology,
                    specifically a Kanban approach.</p>

                <p>The Kanban approach is based off four core principles and six practices, and allows the project to
                    focus on what needs to be done and achieving it in a manageable way. The first principle looks at
                    what is currently being done and will allow the Kanban methodology to overlay and fit over the
                    current workflow and methodology. The second principle looks into incrementing small change in a
                    manner that encounters minimal resistance. The third principle addresses organisational structure,
                    roles and responsibilities and allows the Kanban methodology to promote an open method of working.
                    The fourth principle encourages collaboration from all team members with the goal in mind of
                    reaching an optimal performance level. The six practices look at managing the workflow, by
                    visualising it, and limiting the work that is currently in progress, defining a structure to the
                    process itself, integrating feedback loops and increasing the collaboration (Kanbanize, n.d.).</p>

                <p>With the approach being chosen the next step is to break down the goals and objectives into
                    milestones. Milestones will allow for gradual, effective and constant implementation of the strategy
                    (Morpus, 2020). Breaking each of the milestones into smaller tasks fits into the Kanban methodology
                    allowing the project team to realise the benefits of Kanban such as revealing bottlenecks in the
                    workflow, engaging in a more responsive team and promoting a more productive and collaborative
                    environment (Kanbanize, n.d.).</p>

                <p>Once the milestones and tasks have been identified along with appropriate timelines, the project
                    manager will be able to use project management software to work out the critical path and create
                    potential buffers in the project plan to account for potential scope creeps (Morpus, 2020).</p>

                <h2 class="w3-center">6.6. Review</h2>
                <p>The final step and constantly recurring step of the implementation plan would be the review with
                    management and other key stakeholders. The review will allow all the necessary stakeholders to
                    receive constant updates on the implementation, track the progress and monitor and evaluate any
                    changes to business. This will also allow for retrospectives, giving valuable insights as to what
                    has been working well during the implementation, what has not been working well and any major set
                    backs that were encountered and how it was dealt with. Preferably these review sessions would occur
                    at each milestone; where minor milestones would include retrospectives with the project team and
                    major milestones including management and key stakeholders.</p>

                <h1 class="w3-center">7. Organisational Restructure</h1>
                <p>In order for the proposed strategy to be as effective as possible, the organisational structure must
                    be analysed and restructured in order to achieve the organisations objectives.</p>

                <h2 class="w3-center">7.1. Current Organisational Structure</h2>
                <img src="Figure4.png" style="width:100%;" alt="Figure 4">
                <figcaption class="w3-center">Fig.4 - Current Organisational Structure</figcaption>
                <p>Figure 4 presents the current organisational structure, and it can be seen that currently FlyNow
                    Travel has a <em>Divisional</em> structure in their organisation. Although it has been working
                    throughout the years, the pandemic has brought to light the ineffectiveness of the
                    organisation&rsquo;s structure. Since corporate clients are handled by the two Sales Managers and
                    Senior Consultants, the Junior Consultant and Consultant handle all leisure clients alongside one of
                    the Managing Directors. The two Directors oversee all operations relating to both office locations.
                    One of the noticeable disadvantages of the Divisional Structure is that functional activities are
                    duplicated. This type of structure would not work with the proposed strategy as there would be
                    multiple gaps within the organisation that would create multiple management issues and loss of
                    partnerships with potential partners in the industry.</p>

                <h2 class="w3-center">7.2. Proposed Organisational Structure</h2>
                <img src="Figure5.png" style="width:100%;" alt="Figure 5">
                <figcaption class="w3-center">Fig.5 - Proposed Organisational Structure</figcaption>
                <p>Figure 5 presents the proposed organisational structure for FlyNow Travel for the proposed
                    dual-approach strategy. As can be seen from the proposed structure, the organisational structure
                    will move from a <em>Divisional Structure</em> to a <em>Functional Structure</em>.</p>

                <p>The Functional Structure is more catered to the proposed strategy as this allow for more specialised
                    areas that can focus on specific selling points. The proposed structure presented in Figure 5
                    creates a dedicated team for international sales and a dedicated team for local sales. Given that
                    the proposed strategy recommends partnerships with local tour operators and tourist services, this
                    would allow a new revenue stream to reveal itself for FlyNow Travel giving them a distinct advantage
                    over their competitors who would be looking solely at providing local citizens international travel.
                    By dedicating a sales team for international travel and one for local travel, this will allow FlyNow
                    to monitor and expand the business in the relevant space as time goes on, creating a sustainable
                    organisational structure.</p>

                <p>The addition of the IT department with a sole IT consultant caters to the Product Development part of
                    the proposed strategy, whereby FlyNow Travel could explore the digital space. The IT
                    consultant&rsquo;s skills would range depending on the chosen route in the digital space, however in
                    the beginning the necessary skills required would be that of web development and web page
                    maintenance. The second role required in the IT department would be that of a digital marketer, as
                    this person&rsquo;s role would be to increase the digital footprint of FlyNow through the use of
                    social media, building a better presence and utilising the likes of social media and ad services to
                    boost the recognition of the FlyNow Travel brand.</p>

                <p>The organisational restructure is required as the current divisional structure does not work for a
                    travel agency such as FlyNow. Typically, a divisional structure is best suited for companies that
                    offer multiple product offerings or have multiple geographical locations/divisions. The major
                    disadvantage of this structure is that although there is operational flexibility, there is not
                    separation of specialised functions; and for a small business such as FlyNow Travel, this structure
                    is not effective (Lumen Learning, n.d.).</p>


                <p>The proposed functional structure would grant FlyNow efficiency in their operations given their
                    dedicated departments and teams with specialised skills. A disadvantage of using the functional
                    structure is that cross-functional communication may not be effective or may not occur at all. This
                    could lead to a lack of innovation and flexibility within the company as the strategy is implemented
                    and utilised. However, a functional structure is definitely more suited as a travel agency provides
                    a specific type of product, travel and tourism, and has no need for any diversification of products
                    and services offered (Lumen Learning, n.d.).</p>


                <p>A benefit of the proposed structural change is that staff upskilling would become more relevant and
                    specialised. For example, the Directors will no longer be responsible over a sales manager and an
                    accountant but rather be focused on sales and accounting and client development. Their focus becomes
                    aligned with the proposed strategy and will assist in achieving the company&rsquo;s objective. The
                    same benefit of upskilling passes onto the sales team, by allowing them to specialise in their
                    respective departments.</p>

                <p>The corporate clientele that is currently allocated to the two Sales Managers and Senior Consultants
                    would remain with the respective members. The reason for this is that the corporate clientele look
                    to travel only locally and their current point of contact within FlyNow Travel has not changed over
                    the last decade, and given the nature of the contracts with corporate clients, the relationship with
                    these clients can continue with the respective members of the organisation. This will allow FlyNow
                    to utilise the new proposed strategy and its opportunities while maintaining stable growth and level
                    of service provided to their existing customers.</p>

                <h2 class="w3-center">7.3. Critical Analysis</h2>
                <p>As FlyNow Travel is a small business with less than 25 employees, restructuring the organisation may
                    not be as challenging as if it were a larger enterprise. The benefits realised in the restructuring
                    of the organisation are focused more on improving the efficiency of the business operations while
                    expanding it in a localised manner. Given the new opportunities that could arise, it allows the
                    staff opportunities to upskill themselves in order to help execute the implementation of the
                    proposed strategy. However, this upskilling could cost the business more than anticipated as the
                    upskilling may require highly specialised training. With the pandemic ongoing combined with the
                    urgency to implement the proposed strategy, business may not be willing to cover the costs of any
                    extra training. This could potentially be resolved by bringing in management consultants that could
                    assist in the implementation of the proposed strategy as well as facilitate the training of the
                    organisation.</p>

                <p>In all organisations, there will always be resistance to change from all levels of the organisation.
                    Restructuring the organisation may involve downsizing, rightsizing or delayering which may not be
                    accepted by some members of the organisation. The use of the Kanban methodology will allow all
                    members of the organisation to adapt to the changes to the organisation in a gradual manner and will
                    give transparency throughout the entire process. The inclusion of a change manager will assist in
                    adjusting all staff member to the new structure of the organisation.</p>

                <p>The introduction of an IT consultant who&rsquo;s focus would be the website of FlyNow travel may not
                    be accepted by some of the consultants as they may feel that the implementation of this type of
                    technology may make them redundant and could lead to a job loss. To mitigate this, a clear
                    discussion must be had with all stakeholders stating the capabilities of the website in the short
                    and long term. If the website is dedicated to giving quotations on various packages and deals and
                    will connect customers with one of the consultants, this would be a positive change to the
                    organisation. However, should the website be able to process the details and requirements of the
                    customer without the need of a consultant, this may be met with negative reactions from the
                    consultants, as this website could potentially replace them saving the company money.</p>

                <p>The COVID pandemic is still ongoing, and although vaccine rollouts are underway, international
                    leisure travel may not return to normal until the end of 2022 (Business Tech, 2021). The proposed
                    restructure suggests a dedicated team for international travel and one for local travel, and this
                    may create unnecessary friction between the employees as one department has no option but to wait
                    until the pandemic is over, whereas the other department would become the most prioritised and
                    crucial department of FlyNow Travel. Mitigating this concern may be the most challenging as this is
                    not something that management nor the proposed strategy can control. This is something that is
                    dependent on the effect of the vaccine, and foreign government&rsquo;s travel restrictions.</p>

                <p>Overall, the proposed dual-approach strategic plan and organisational restructure would have a
                    positive effect on FlyNow Travel and would allow them to grow the business in a sustainable manner
                    for the foreseeable future.</p>

                <h1 class="w3-center">8. Recommendations and Conclusions</h1>
                <p>Although the proposed strategic plan and implementation plan would address all of FlyNow&rsquo;s
                    concerns involving their competitors, and potential opportunities that they could use to their
                    advantage and boost their business. The proposed approach tackles multiple aspects in a digital and
                    business first manner. During the implementation of the strategy, there could be a better way of
                    executing the strategy and the implementation of it. A more extensive analysis of the dual-approach
                    strategy could be done to determine if the proposed strategy would be sustainable for the next 10
                    years. Subsequently, qualified or trained professionals may be required to ensure that the
                    implementation of the proposed strategy is done so in the correct manner.</p>

                <p>In conclusion, FlyNow Travel&rsquo;s current situation has been evaluated and presented. The
                    stakeholders were identified and analysed and were categorised as having an impact on FlyNow or
                    being impacted by FlyNow. The stakeholders were further mapped to determine their relative power and
                    interest with regards to the business. An environmental analysis was done, looking at both internal
                    and external factors. The external environment was analysed using the PESTLE analysis and internal
                    was done using the SWOT analysis. A dual-approach strategy combining the Product Development and
                    Merger strategic approach was proposed for FlyNow detailing its benefits over other strategies. An
                    implementation plan was presented and recommendations have been given for the analysis on FlyNow.
