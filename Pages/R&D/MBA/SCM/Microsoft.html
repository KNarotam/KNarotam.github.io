            <h1 class="w3-center">Executive Summary</h1>
            <p>Since its conception Microsoft has seen a meteoric rise in the technology industry. Currently
                15<sup>th</sup> on the Fortune 500 list, the company is focused around their customers and empowering
                them to recognise their potential. In 2014, Satya Nadella became CEO of Microsoft and with his
                leadership came multiple changes. Microsoft&rsquo;s need for change is explored by conducting a SWOT
                analysis, whereby the weaknesses and threats present the major cases for change. Most notably, Microsoft
                has a need for change in their cybersecurity, acquisitions, and innovation skills. Two change management
                models, Prosci ADKAR and the Kaizen continuous cycle, are presented aligning each model to a case for
                change, respectively in changing the organisation culture and performance management; and addressing the
                cybersecurity issues. Three major changes are discussed in recent times with their barriers or supposed
                barriers to change being discussed. Lastly, recommendations are given for addressing Microsoft&rsquo;s
                weaknesses such as lack of innovation and cybersecurity issues.</p>

            <h1 class="w3-center">1. Introduction</h1>
            <p>Microsoft is one of the world&rsquo;s most recognised brands, a leader in the technological industry,
                with a deep-rooted history in adapting to changing technology and times, the company has seen a meteoric
                rise placing it 15<sup>th</sup> in the Fortune 500 list. The company&rsquo;s vision and mission are
                focused around people and businesses and empowering them to realise their potential, ultimately helping
                them achieve their potential. Microsoft&rsquo;s mission is &ldquo;to empower every person and every
                organization on the planet to achieve more&rdquo;, with their vision being &ldquo;to help people and
                businesses throughout the world realise their full potential&rdquo; (Microsoft Corporation,
                2021)&nbsp;(Gregory, 2019).</p>
            <p>Since its inception, Microsoft rapidly developed their operating systems and programs that allowed them
                to outperform their current rivals at the time. As the Internet began to evolve, Microsoft created their
                landmark program Windows NT, quickly taking over the majority of the market share from then leader
                Novell NetWare. Although the company tried to maintain a monopoly on the industry, Microsoft&rsquo;s
                ability to adapt to its ever-increasing challenges were seamless and allowed them to maintain market
                share (Hall, 2020).</p>
            <p>As the 21<sup>st</sup> century began, Microsoft branched their offerings into the gaming and mobile
                phones industry. As the Xbox was developed and introduced to the industry, Microsoft has quickly risen
                to become market leader in the gaming industry constantly competing with current rivals Sony and
                Nintendo. With the rise of Google, Microsoft looked at adapting the company and purchasing Yahoo! and
                subsequent subsidiaries to improve their search engine to compete with the likes of Google. Furthermore,
                as technology advanced and cloud computing has become the forefront of the industry, Microsoft adapted
                and built their own service Azure to compete with Google and Amazon who are the market leaders in the
                cloud computing and infrastructure space. Subsequently, as the company was taken into the Fourth
                Industrial Revolution, the leadership of the company changed, with Microsoft&rsquo;s current CEO, Satya
                Nadella, being appointed as CEO in 2010 (Hall, 2020).</p>
            <p>With each advancement and change seen in Microsoft, whether it was an internal change, or change to
                business strategy, the company has seen drastic increase in revenue, market share, and industry
                ownership, ultimately becoming a market leader within that sector itself. Microsoft is not scared to
                adapt and change as technology and time does to ensure that they remain competitive, and a market
                leader. Most notably, after Satya Nadella&rsquo;s appointment, in 2014, Microsoft&rsquo;s future seemed
                to be on a downward trend with sales and services becoming outdated and old. Nadella&rsquo;s approach
                and change focused around digital transformation affected the company in a drastically positive manner,
                resulting in a trillion-dollar gain (Denning, 2021).</p>
            <p>The consistent changes in the company has allowed Microsoft to break through financial predictions and
                navigate the COVID-19 pandemic successfully by adapting to the circumstances. This was done through
                increasing current capabilities to provide real-time response for hospitals, using technology to reduce
                transmission of the virus, supporting education through their programs and partners, and further
                supporting global communities through donations and connections (Edmond, 2020).</p>

            <h1 class="w3-center">2. Need for Change</h1>
            <p>In order to understand the need for change in Microsoft, a SWOT analysis can be undertaken to identify
                the various factors to assist in strategic decisions for the future of the company. The <em>strengths
                </em>identified will be the factors Microsoft can continue to capitalise on to ensure sustainable
                growth, whereas the <em>weaknesses</em> identified will be contributing factors to the case for change.
                Subsequently, the<em> opportunities</em> will contribute to the case for change as this will identify
                areas where Microsoft can implement something new or alter ways of working to benefit the company.
                Lastly, the <em>threats</em> identified will be a deciding factor on the case for change to see if any
                changes implemented will assist in minimising or eliminating the factors identified. Figure 1 presents a
                high-level SWOT analysis of Microsoft in recent history and currently.</p>

            <h2 class="w3-center">2.1. SWOT Analysis</h2>
            <img src="Figure1.jpg" style="width:100%;" alt="Figure 1">
            <figcaption class="w3-center">Fig.1 - Microsoft SWOT Analysis (Bush, 2016) (Jurevicius, 2021) (Parker, 2021)
            </figcaption>
            <p>Based on the SWOT analysis done in Figure 1, Microsoft has a multitude of opportunities to strive
                towards, and a strong foundational set of strengths that they can continue to build on. However, the
                identified weaknesses and threats present to them outweigh the company&rsquo;s current strengths.
                Microsoft&rsquo;s need for change stems from the identified weaknesses and some identified
                opportunities.</p>
            <p>The high-price point combined with the threat of open source projects presents Microsoft with a major
                case for change. Although the Windows operating system and the Microsoft Office suite are widely
                preferred and used; there are multiple open-source options available and becoming increasingly popular
                such as Linux&rsquo;s operating system and Google suite (Bush, 2016). Furthermore, the hyper-competitive
                technology industry is a constant threat to Microsoft, with major tech giants such as Apple and Google
                having just as much of a global reach, impact, and influence. Combined with rival companies, open source
                software produces provide many alternatives to Microsoft and their offerings (Parker, 2021).</p>
            <p>Microsoft has seen substantial growth through successful acquisitions such as that of LinkedIn, however
                not all acquisitions are as successful. This is one of Microsoft&rsquo;s biggest weaknesses, by
                investing and making poor decisions in acquisitions like LinkExchange, Massive, Danger, and WebTV, the
                company is forced to re-evaluate these decisions resulting in divestitures (Parker, 2021).</p>
            <p>The Windows operating system is majorly criticised for its weakness against various virus attacks,
                currently being the least protected when compared to competitor operating systems (Jurevicius, 2021).
                This extends to scam calls and such increasing the cybercrime cases against Microsoft and the operating
                system. With an increase in the number of cybercrimes, Microsoft needs to change their way of developing
                security measures for their customers to ensure that users&rsquo; privacy is kept. Should this not be
                attended to, it can increase the number of legal proceedings that Microsoft already face.</p>
            <p>The company is many and constant legal battles based on unfair practices such as attempting to monopolise
                the industry in certain regions, or infringing on certain patents (Parker, 2021). Over the last two
                years, 3% of Microsoft&rsquo;s revenue is dedicated to &ldquo;General and Administrative&rdquo; expenses
                which include that of legal fees (Microsoft Corporation, 2021). Given that Microsoft has faced many
                legal battles and lost various large-scale lawsuits, this poses a major case for change in the
                organisation, as this can form part of a strategic initiative to alter the way of operating to reduce
                the probability of future expensive lawsuits (Jurevicius, 2021).</p>
            <p>In addition to this, Microsoft is slow to innovate, for example, the company had the necessary technology
                and resources to enter the mobile phone industry in a timely manner. However, due to the lack of
                innovation from the organisation, the industry is now dominated by Google and Apple, leaving little room
                for any new entrants given their constant innovation in the industry (Jurevicius, 2021). This does
                provide Microsoft for a case for change as it will allow the company to analyse, understand, and
                strategically plan for ways to improve their innovation techniques and find ways of disrupting currently
                dominated industries and markets.</p>
            <p>Lastly, there is a need for change in Microsoft&rsquo;s current workforce due to its imbalance in
                diversity from a women and minority perspective. This extends to HR policies that may need to be changed
                and updated to cater for a less criticised workforce (Parker, 2021).</p>

            <h1 class="w3-center">3. Change Management Models</h1>

            <h2 class="w3-center">3.1. Prosci ADKAR Change Management Model</h2>
            <p>In an attempt to improve the way Microsoft tracked their sales and operations across various regions and
                roles, various teams within the company created, delivered, and drove the adoption of MSX Insights
                (MSXi). MSXi is a modernised business intelligence reporting solution that is used by various roles and
                teams within Microsoft such as salespeople, company leaders, managers, finance and operations teams
                (Delaini, 2021).</p>
            <p>The Prosci ADKAR model was the perfect change management model for Microsoft to use in this
                implementation as it focuses on people of all levels in order for the change to be effective. Microsoft
                had engaged the project with identifying the different needs of leaders, managers, front-line sellers.
                Figure 2 presents the definition of the ADKAR model and how it was used on a high-level within
                Microsoft. The benefit of using this model was that it allowed the change management team to gain
                valuable insights on the resources and behaviours of the employees, and where to focus the resources to
                encourage the shift. This was further accompanied by structured feedback channels (Delaini, 2021).</p>
            <img src="Figure2.jpg" style="width:100%;" alt="Figure 2">
            <figcaption class="w3-center">Fig.2 - Prosci ADKAR Model used by Microsoft</figcaption>
            <p>The ADKAR model was followed each time the change was introduced to a new level or department. Having
                identified the need for the change and making senior management and all levels aware of the change, to
                identifying the benefits of the proposed change building the desire in each person. This further
                extended to creating a close partnership between Microsoft Digital, engineering teams, and adoption and
                landing teams to assist in making the effective change, implementing it seamlessly and now reinforcing
                the change throughout the company is all regions (Delaini, 2021).</p>

            <h2 class="w3-center">3.2. Kaizen Change Management Model</h2>
            <p>As one of their biggest weaknesses, Microsoft must look to improving their cybersecurity with regards to
                the software and operating systems. As digital transformation is being experienced in most businesses,
                cybersecurity has become one of the key capabilities. Although cybersecurity can be implemented through
                various frameworks and technologies, human error can still cause a breach in the system, which is why
                clear communication and recurrent training on the most recent and prevalent practices is key to ensuring
                a strong cybersecurity capability&nbsp;(Panorama Consulting Group, 2020).</p>
            <p>Emma Ryttare identifies two change management models that can be used and implemented with cybersecurity
                implementations, which are: Kotter&rsquo;s theory of change management; and Lewin&rsquo;s change
                management model. It is highlighted that within these models there are core aspects of effective change
                management which look at how to engage with employees of all levels, understanding the behaviour towards
                the change (Ryttare, 2019). Danial Beck further confirms these core aspects by stating that for
                effective cybersecurity change, understanding and engaging with various e-consumers on the initiatives
                is needed, as well as instilling a cybersecurity purpose and value system. Ultimately, ensuring that
                there is effective employee buy-in and constant feedback in the implementations (Beck, 2019).</p>
            <p>Understanding the core aspects of effective change management, it can be argued that Kaizen&rsquo;s cycle
                for continuous improvement would be an effective change management model for Microsoft. This model will
                allow the organisation to implement cybersecurity as a continuous process rather than a one-time
                transition. Furthermore, it gives employees more control over changes, building more trust. Figure 3
                shows the steps of the Kaizen model for continuous improvement.</p>

                    change, identifying root causes, and gathering information from multiple sources, making low-cost,
                    small improvements, and identifying solutions as mistakes are uncovered; the model is synonymous

            <h1 class="w3-center">4. Major Types of Change</h1>

            <h2 class="w3-center">4.1. Organisational Performance Management and Culture</h2>
            <p>As Satya Nadella took over Microsoft, he saw how and where the company could improve. The first email he
                had sent highlighted where the company should be focusing their energy and efforts. Furthermore, Nadella
                saw a way to drastically impact the employees and teams of Microsoft by changing the company&rsquo;s
                current performance review methodology and culture. The performance management was restructured within
                the company from making internal teams compete with one another, also known as <em>stack ranking</em>,
                to performance reviews focused on constructive conversations. This drastically changed the mindset of
                employees to having one of a growth mindset&nbsp;(McLaren, 2019) (Chaudhary, 2021)&nbsp;(London, 2018).
            </p>
            <p>The impact of changing the mindset of the organisation as well as the performance management of the teams
                resulted in Microsoft being able to align better with their customers, improving their products, and
                seeing the success that it brought (London, 2018). This impact of the culture change coupled with the
                new strategic plan, was further seen in Microsoft&rsquo;s valuation reaching the $1 trillion mark after
                5 years of Nadella&rsquo;s appointment as CEO. Nadella understood that in order for Microsoft to further
                succeed in the ever-changing industry, a culture built around collaboration, learning, growth, and the
                customer, which was further instilled from the top level down (Chaudhary, 2021).</p>

            <h2 class="w3-center">4.2. Intelligence Driven Organisation</h2>
            <p>As cloud computing and AI became the focus of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, Microsoft adapted their
                way of approaching the market and industry from a different perspective. Similar to the culture and
                performance management change, Nadella implemented a change in focus and strategy in Microsoft, stating
                the company should focus on mobile and cloud as it will allow the company to maximise the value of
                technology, enabling Microsoft to empower their customers, ultimately finding the balance between using
                the data to create personal, intelligent experiences while maintaining privacy and security of their
                customers (Fried, 2014).</p>
            <p>The growth mindset was the foundation of transforming the company into an intelligence driven
                organisation. Through the Microsoft Consulting Services (MCS), the company was able to utilise the long
                list of global companies to unlock powerful insights, enhance security, and empower the teams with
                organisational agility ultimately leaving these clients with the competitive edge. This led Microsoft to
                developing the Intelligent Driven Organisation (IDO) Model, a framework that allows businesses to
                utilise digital feedback loops in developing executive strategies, building and ensuring the correct
                technical capabilities are in place, improving the day-to-day task execution, leading the organisation
                to achieving their desired outcomes (Chavatte, 2020).</p>
            <p>Leveraging the data of the customers, Microsoft is able to turn their implementation of AI into value.
                The benefit of utilising the IDO framework, and the capabilities of the company, Microsoft was able to
                complete two years&rsquo; worth of digital transformation within two months. Furthermore, as Microsoft
                is able to offer this as a service to their clients through their own platforms of Azure, machine
                learning, AI, and other technical capabilities; Microsoft is able to be increasingly competitive in the
                market and a leader in the industry (Forbes Technology Council, 2018) (Walden, 2021).</p>

            <h2 class="w3-center">4.3. Implementation of Microsoft Teams</h2>
            <p>COVID-19 impacted the global economy and every industry in some way or the other, with majority of the
                workforce beginning to work remotely. Products like Zoom, Google Meetings, Cisco Webex, and TeamViewer
                were beginning to see an increase in usage to aid in remote working. Although Microsoft Skype and Skype
                for Business was readily available and in use, Microsoft saw an opportunity to combine the capabilities
                of cloud and cloud collaboration, chat applications, and video conferencing with a user-friendly
                interface, which led to the creation of Microsoft Teams (Protalinski, 2020).</p>
            <p>The usage of Teams has seen a drastic increase during the pandemic, becoming the preferred choice for
                communication in businesses across the world. In 2020, 95 million users were added to Teams, having
                grown exponentially since its creation. While Teams is not a standalone product but rather part of the
                Office 365 offerings, it can be said to contribute to the increase in revenue of the product for
                Microsoft, with $6.8 million being generated by Office 365 in 2020 (Curry, 2021).</p>

            <h1 class="w3-center">5. Barriers to Change</h1>
            <p>Prior to the appointment of Satya Nadella, Microsoft was heading for turmoil as a company. In 2014, as
                the company had acquired Nokia, Microsoft had realised a major mistake in the acquisition, as due to the
                lack of innovation, the investment seemed to be one that conformed to previous unsuccessful investments.
                This resulted in 13000 employees being laid off in 2014 due to the current organisational change at the
                time. After Nadella&rsquo;s appointment as CEO, the changes he had suggested were met with minimal
                resistance, however given the drastic change proposed, there would multiple barriers, mainly a cultural
                change barrier, as this impacts employees&rsquo; beliefs, thoughts, and assumptions (S, n.d.).</p>
            <p>One of the strategies used by Microsoft was Lewin&rsquo;s Change Management Model, of unfreezing,
                changing and refreezing. Coca-Cola has seen multiple changes to the company over its history and has
                utilised the Lewin model multiple times in order to better engage with their employees (UK Essays,
                2021). Nadella engaged with the employees of all levels very closely in various ways such as focus
                groups, individually, or anonymously (Chaudhary, 2021).</p>
            <p>With the focus of digital transformation being around security and privacy matters, there are multiple
                challenges that CSOs face when improving their cybersecurity. As technology improves and more innovation
                is introduced, so does the dangers of cybersecurity, leading to a major change barrier of information
                overload. Although companies such as Microsoft are able to store the data, utilising it to its full
                potential may be a challenge. Furthermore, while Microsoft may provide the tools to allow other
                companies to improve their cybersecurity, given the state and vulnerability of Windows, there may be a
                change barrier due to insufficient integration, human bottlenecks, credential trusts, and soft targets
                (Vanderburg, 2019).</p>
            <p>Microsoft&rsquo;s funding into approaching these barriers related to cybersecurity by increasing spending
                in the capability by $20 billion over the next 5 years. This tactic will allow Microsoft in identifying
                the relevant talent for the job; addressing major government flaws; and finding new ways of sourcing
                talent in the technological field (Rosenbaum, 2021). While no technology company has flawless
                cybersecurity, Microsoft&rsquo;s investment into the field to improve it is an innovative way to
                overcome the change barriers.</p>
            <p>Microsoft&rsquo;s current challenges include mobile, cloud ecosystem, and newer business offerings. While
                mobile and cloud challenges can be managed and effectively executed through innovation and designated
                change management plan such as LaMarsh&rsquo;s change model or Kazien&rsquo;s cycle for improvement; it
                is Microsoft&rsquo;s new offerings such as Power Platform that can present many change barriers. Given
                it is utilising AI and elements of a new digital transformation; procedural barriers such as the lack of
                expertise to implement the change, or lack of customer focus can cause problems for Microsoft.</p>
            <p>Once again, through the cultural and organisational change undertaken by Microsoft over the last 5 years
                will allow the company to mitigate risks and overcome the various change barriers. By working in a more
                collaborative way and including the customer feedback at various stages, Microsoft will be able to
                overcome many barriers they are faced with when introducing new products or platforms into the market.
            </p>

            <h1 class="w3-center">6. Recommendations and Conclusions</h1>
            <h2 class="w3-center">6.1. Recommendations</h2>
            <p>Microsoft is a leader in the technology industry, and a constant threat in any market that they enter.
                Although the company has many phenomenal strengths and an ever growing customer base and revenue, the
                threats and weaknesses that are present to the company must be addressed constantly and consistently to
                maintain the company&rsquo;s reputation, valuation, and customer support.</p>
            <p>Given that cybersecurity is one of Microsoft&rsquo;s major weaknesses and threats, it can be recommended
                that going forward, focus on continuous improvements in the area. By implementing cybersecurity
                improvements as change management, Microsoft will be able to potentially turn this weakness into one of
                their strengths. Furthermore, by addressing the customer concern of cybersecurity, Microsoft may be able
                to improve and gain a larger customer base due to this.</p>
            <p>It can also be recommended to address Microsoft&rsquo;s ability to acquire various subsidiary companies.
                Given that unsuccessful acquisitions are one of Microsoft&rsquo;s weaknesses, if not their greatest
                weakness, using various change management principles, Microsoft could invest the money within their own
                research and development teams, to build and improve their innovation. Microsoft has been known to have
                missed various opportunities in the mobile phone and cloud regardless of having the technology to be a
                major competitor and market leader. However, dedicating some investment and building a culture around
                innovation similar to that seen in Tesla, will allow Microsoft to identify new markets to enter and
                rapidly become a market and industry leader.</p>

            <h2 class="w3-center">6.2. Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Microsoft is a leader in the technology industry, and has consistently been a leader since its
                conception. As the Fourth Industrial Revolution ushered in the internet and the digital transformation,
                Microsoft too adapted, albeit in a slow manner. The company seemed to lack innovation after Bill Gates
                had stepped away as CEO, however in 2014, when Satya Nadella was appointed, he brought with him a world
                of change.</p>
            <p>Within 5 years, under Nadella&rsquo;s leadership, Microsoft was able to become more innovative,
                respected, and reach a $1 trillion valuation. The need for change at Microsoft was identified through
                the use of the SWOT analysis with the focus being on Microsoft&rsquo;s operating system and software
                being vulnerable and having weak cybersecurity management. Subsequently, Microsoft&rsquo;s lack of
                innovation or ability to be slow to innovate presented another need for change in the company. Two
                change management models, Prosci ADKAR and the Kaizen continuous cycle, were presented to their
                applications in changing Microsoft into an intelligence-driven organisation and cybersecurity matters
                respectively. Furthermore, three major changes were explored in the company and their impacts defined as
                well as various barriers to change to the major changes. Laslty, recommendations are given on how to
                assist Microsoft in improving their cybersecurity and become more innovative.</p>
